A lot. Constantly. Take my word when I say that you and Emi will become one. I felt every emotion as if I was in the story. I could have been Emi.” - Kelli, Alphas, Authors and Books Oh My Emi Hennigan could never have predicted her life would be like this. After wasting more than ten years being “just a friend” to her true love, Nate Wilson, Emi feels more than a little regret. Her future was set, though. Nate loved her as much as she loved him, and they were moving forward with a romance that took them both by surprise. They already knew their bad habits, quirks and the subtle nuances of expressions, but the love was all-encompassing and new to them both. No man could compete, Emi thought, until one night – one evening, one party, one journey, one second alters her course completely. That night, her brother’s confident best friend, Jack Holland, comes back into her life with a mission: to spend more time with Emi to prove he is the right man for her. A romance with him is the furthest thing from Emi’s mind, though, staying loyal and steadfast to a trusted man that she will always love. In a year’s time, though, Emi must learn to make changes she’d never before considered after being impacted by unexpected events. While her fragile spirit takes time to heal, Jack slowly finds a comfortable place in her life. Only time will tell if it’s right for Emi – and enough for him.

5430,John Irving,"In 1954, in the cookhouse of a logging and sawmill settlement in northern New Hampshire, an anxious twelve-year-old boy mistakes the local constable’s girlfriend for a bear. Both the twelve-year-old and his father become fugitives, forced to run from Coos County–to Boston, to southern Vermont, to Toronto–pursued by the implacable constable. Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them.In a story spanning five decades, Last Night in Twisted River–John Irving’s twelfth novel–depicts the recent half-century in the United States as “a living replica of Coos County, where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course.” From the novel’s taut opening sentence–“The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long”–to its elegiac final chapter, Last Night in Twisted River is written with the historical authenticity and emotional authority of The Cider House Rules and A Prayer for Owen Meany. It is also as violent and disturbing a story as John Irving’s breakthrough bestseller, The World According to Garp.What further distinguishes Last Night in Twisted River is the author’s unmistakable voice–the inimitable voice of an accomplished storyteller. Near the end of this moving novel, John Irving writes: “We don’t always have a choice how we get to know one another. Sometimes, people fall into our lives cleanly–as if out of the sky, or as if there were a direct flight from Heaven to Earth–the same sudden way we lose people, who once seemed they would always be part of our lives.”",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,554,3.75,22077,2703,Last Night in Twisted River,Fiction|Contemporary|Historical|Historical Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1399850194l/6323821.jpg,554,,,,,,,,,

Givens offers a full-length treatment of this influential work, illuminating the varied meanings and tempestuous impact of this uniquely American scripture. Givens examines the text's role as a divine testament of the Last Days and as a sacred sign of Joseph Smith's status as a modern-day prophet. He assesses its claim to be a history of the pre-Columbian peopling of the Western Hemisphere, and later explores how the Book has been defined as a cultural product--the imaginative ravings of a rustic religion-maker. Givens further investigates its status as a new American Bible or Fifth Gospel, one that displaces, supports, or, in some views, perverts the canonical Word of God. Finally, Givens highlights the Book's role as the engine behind what may become the next world religion.

32668,Erika Johansen,"Magic, adventure, mystery, and romance combine in this epic debut in which a young princess must reclaim her dead mother’s throne, learn to be a ruler—and defeat the Red Queen, a powerful and malevolent sorceress determined to destroy her.On her nineteenth birthday, Princess Kelsea Raleigh Glynn, raised in exile, sets out on a perilous journey back to the castle of her birth to ascend her rightful throne. Plain and serious, a girl who loves books and learning, Kelsea bears little resemblance to her mother, the vain and frivolous Queen Elyssa. But though she may be inexperienced and sheltered, Kelsea is not defenseless: Around her neck hangs the Tearling sapphire, a jewel of immense magical power; and accompanying her is the Queen’s Guard, a cadre of brave knights led by the enigmatic and dedicated Lazarus. Kelsea will need them all to survive a cabal of enemies who will use every weapon—from crimson-caped assassins to the darkest blood magic—to prevent her from wearing the crown.Despite her royal blood, Kelsea feels like nothing so much as an insecure girl, a child called upon to lead a people and a kingdom about which she knows almost nothing.

To his master’s consternation, the cat immediately begins to tell lies (the first being that he didn’t eat the parrot).

She is considered one of the outstanding Indian poets writing in English, although her popularity in Kerala is based chiefly on her short stories and autobiography. Much of her writing in Malayalam came under the pen name Madhavikkutty. She was born on March 31, 1934 in Malabar in Kerala, India. She is the daughter of V.M. Nair, a former managing editor of the widely-circulated Malayalam daily Mathrubhumi, and Nalappatt Balamani Amma, a renowned Malayali poetess. In 1984, she was short-listed for the Nobel Prize for Literature along with Marguerite Yourcenar, Doris Lessing, and Nadine Gordimer. Kamala Das is probably the first Hindu woman to openly and honestly talk about sexual desires of Indian woman, which made her an iconoclast of her generation.

15268,Victor Klemperer|Martin Chalmers,"The publication of Victor Klemperer's secret diaries brings to light one of the most extraordinary documents of the Nazi period. ""In its cool, lucid style and power of observation,"" said The New York Times, ""it is the best  written, most evocative, most observant record of daily life in the Third Reich."" I Will Bear Witness is a work of literature as well as a revelation of the day-by-day horror of the Nazi years.                           A Dresden Jew, a veteran of World War I, a man of letters and historian of great sophistication, Klemperer recognized the danger of Hitler as early as 1933. His diaries, written in secrecy, provide a vivid account of everyday life in Hitler's Germany.                          What makes this book so remarkable, aside from its literary distinction, is Klemperer's preoccupation with the thoughts and actions of ordinary Germans: Berger the greengrocer, who was given Klemperer's house (""anti-Hitlerist, but of course pleased at the good exchange""), the fishmonger, the baker, the much-visited dentist. All offer their thoughts and theories on the progress of the war: Will England hold out? Who listens to Goebbels? How much longer will it last?                          This symphony of voices is ordered by the brilliant, grumbling Klemperer, struggling to complete his work on eighteenth-century France while documenting the ever- tightening Nazi grip. He loses first his professorship and then his car, his phone, his house, even his typewriter, and is forced to move into a Jews' House (the last step before the camps), put his cat to death (Jews may not own pets), and suffer countless other indignities.                           Despite the danger his diaries would pose if discovered, Klemperer sees it as his duty to record events. ""I continue to write,"" he notes in 1941 after a terrifying run-in with the police. ""This is my heroics. I want to bear witness, precise witness, until the very end.""   When a neighbor remarks that, in his isolation, Klemperer will not be able to cover the main events of the war, he writes: ""It's not the big things that are important, but the everyday life of  tyranny, which may be forgotten. A thousand mosquito bites are worse than a blow on the head. I observe, I note, the mosquito bites.""                          This book covers the years from 1933 to 1941.

24513,Christopher Ash,"Why does a good God allow innocent suffering? Why does a just God act unfairly? Why does a sovereign God let disease and evil run rampant? These are not questions asked from the onlooker's armchair, nor from the academic's desk, but from the anguish of the sickbed and the frustration of the wheelchair: The problem of pain is considered with the heart as well as the head. In Out of the Storm: Grappling With God in the Book of Job, Christopher Ash leads us through the biblical story of Job as we wrestle with these questions today. He explores honestly the lonely and cruel nature of suffering and whether or not God can be found in the midst of it. He exposes the shortcomings of Job's friends, who deny the possibility of innocent suffering and are unaware of the roles that evil, the fall and the cross have to play. With compassion and clarity he takes the reader through Job's long debate with God towards a humbling-and hopeful-resolution.

Take my word when I say that you and Emi will become one. I felt every emotion as if I was in the story. I could have been Emi.” - Kelli, Alphas, Authors and Books Oh My Emi Hennigan could never have predicted her life would be like this. After wasting more than ten years being “just a friend” to her true love, Nate Wilson, Emi feels more than a little regret. Her future was set, though. Nate loved her as much as she loved him, and they were moving forward with a romance that took them both by surprise. They already knew their bad habits, quirks and the subtle nuances of expressions, but the love was all-encompassing and new to them both. No man could compete, Emi thought, until one night – one evening, one party, one journey, one second alters her course completely. That night, her brother’s confident best friend, Jack Holland, comes back into her life with a mission: to spend more time with Emi to prove he is the right man for her. A romance with him is the furthest thing from Emi’s mind, though, staying loyal and steadfast to a trusted man that she will always love. In a year’s time, though, Emi must learn to make changes she’d never before considered after being impacted by unexpected events. While her fragile spirit takes time to heal, Jack slowly finds a comfortable place in her life. Only time will tell if it’s right for Emi – and enough for him.

Carece de sentimientos, carece de miedo y su espíritu rezuma despecho y ansia por devolver el dolor sufrido. Ahora, tiene la posibilidad de obtener aquello que más anhela: someter a Bryn y hacerle pagar por partirle el corazón. Sin embargo, mientras se ciega en su furia, no solo podría perder de vista la misión de encontrar a Gungnir, la lanza de Odín; también podría perder el respeto de aquellos que le rodean y la oportunidad de recibir una explicación por parte de la Generala que podría cambiarlo todo. Pero, ¿cómo puede escuchar un hombre al que nada le ofende impunemente? Bryn La Salvaje lleva eones flagelándose por la decisión que tomó y que afectó de lleno a Ardan. Sus palabras lo alejaron de ella, rompieron su kompromiss y congelaron las alas de su einherjar, el hombre por el que hubiera dado su vida a ciegas. Las alas de ambos están heladas y azules. Pero ahora, ella y su ejército de valkyrias se encuentran en Escocia luchando por recuperar el último de los totems divinos de los dioses que fueron robados del Asgard. La Generala estará, contra su voluntad, en manos del duro highlander, pero no rendirá hasta demostrarle al escocés déspota y dominante que puede someter su cuerpo, pero nunca su alma ni su corazón. Una palabra de Ardan la devolvería al Valhall sin honores; y una pregunta del guerrero de ojos caramelo podría cambiar la relación entre ellos. ¿Le importará ella lo suficiente como para preguntarle por qué hizo lo que hizo? ¿Aprenderá Ardan que no se puede someter a alguien tan disciplinado y honorable como Bryn? El Midgard empieza temblar. La tierra se agrieta y de sus entrañas nace una terrible rebelión. Los portales se empiezan a activar uno detrás de otro y Gungnir, todavía extraviada, no debe clavarse en ninguno de ellos. La guerra está a la vuelta de la esquina. Pero no hay batalla más sangrienta que la que estalla entre dos guerreros de alas congeladas. El hielo seco de ella puede quemar tanto como el despachado fuego de él. Que arda el Midgard.",,,,484,4.08,966,85,El libro de Ardan,Fantasy|Paranormal|Romance|Paranormal Romance|Fantasy|Romance,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1365012751l/17728877.jpg,484,,,,,,,,,

47058,Bill Yenne,"Area 51's most important military aviation developments are profiled in an illustrated format. When most of us think of Area 51, we think of aliens, UFOs, and controversial government cover-ups. It's easy to forget that, since the mid-1950s, the United States' famed extension of Edwards Air Force Base has served as a top-secret CIA testing ground for many of the most groundbreaking advancements in American military aviation technology. In Area 51 - Black Jets, author and military historian Bill Yenne offers the first fully illustrated chronology of Area 51's most famous aircraft projects, including Lockheed's U-2 ""Dragon Lady"" and SR-71 ""Blackbird"" reconnaissance planes, drones ranging from the early Lockheed D-21 to the modern-day General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and the famous F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter produced by the Have Blue program during the 1970s. Each project is given its own fascinating chapter illuminating the aircraft's development at this famed location. But beyond the aircraft themselves, Area 51 - Black Jets also covers a handful of the many classified experimental programs carried out at Area 51 over the years, such as Have Doughnut, Have Ferry, and Have Drill - secret undertakings that successfully reverse-engineered such enemy aircraft as the Russian MiG during the Cold War.

Panchaali is swept into their quest to reclaim their birthright, remaining at their side through years of exile and a terrible civil war involving all the important kings of India. Meanwhile, we never lose sight of her strategic duels with her mother-in-law, her complicated friendship with the enigmatic Krishna, or her secret attraction to the mysterious man who is her husbands' most dangerous enemy.

He was America's best, with a record-breaking kill in Vietnam - a man who could be hidden, motionless, for days at a time, waiting for the microsecond in which he would take out an enemy with one clean shot at 1,300 yards. He did this 96 times. In recognition, the Marine Corps renamed its sniper range in his honor. Now Gray just wants to quietly live out his life as an assistant U.S. district attorney in New York, where he is raising three adopted children, all victims of the war he is trying resolutely to forget - and atone for. He never wants to see a rifle again. But suddenly, twenty-five years after Gray placed his Winchester rifle in the Marine Corps museum, a sniper is hunting him through the streets of New York City. The sniper's bullets find their mark. But the mark is not Gray. The sniper is challenging him, warning him that he will keep on killing until Gray picks up his rifle one more time.... Gray, falling in love with a woman who is beginning to break through his shell, is determined to protect her and his children.

45972,Geoffrey C. Ward,"He was the first black heavyweight champion in history, the most celebrated-and most reviled-African American of his age. In ""Unforgivable Blackness,"" the prizewinning biographer Geoffrey C. Ward brings to vivid life the real Jack Johnson, a figure far more complex and compelling than the newspaper headlines he inspired could ever convey. Johnson battled his way from obscurity to the top of the heavyweight ranks and in 1908 won the greatest prize in American sports-one that had always been the private preserve of white boxers. At a time when whites ran everything in America, he took orders from no one and resolved to live as if color did not exist. While most blacks struggled just to survive, he reveled in his riches and his fame. And at a time when the mere suspicion that a black man had flirted with a white woman could cost him his life, he insisted on sleeping with whomever he pleased, and married three. Because he did so the federal government set out to destroy him, and he was forced to endure a year of prison and seven years of exile. Ward points out that to most whites (and to some African Americans as well) he was seen as a perpetual threat-profligate, arrogant, amoral, a dark menace, and a danger to the natural order of things.""Unforgivable Blackness"" is the first full-scale biography of Johnson in more than twenty years. Accompanied by more than fifty photographs and drawing on a wealth of new material-including Johnson's never-before-published prison memoir-it restores Jack Johnson to his rightful place in the pantheon of American individualists.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,546,4.21,647,54,Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson,Biography|Sports and Games|Sports|Nonfiction|History|Cultural|African American|North American Hi...|American History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347230379l/293672.jpg,546,,,,,,,,,

His questions of faith surrounding his father's run-of-the-mill Christianity and his mother's suppressed Judaism lead him to a bizarre obsession with the idea of the messiah. After the collapse of his latest affair and his introduction to a reclusive physics professor, Karl is given the opportunity to confront his obsession and take a journey that no man has taken before, and from which he knows he cannot return. Upon arriving in Palestine, AD 29, Glogauer finds that Jesus Christ is not the man that history and faith would like to believe, but that there is an opportunity for someone to change the course of history by making the ultimate sacrifice.

But there was no solid evidence linking him to the crime. He married again, for the fifth time, and his stunning new wife, a physician named Sara, adopted his three sons. They all settled down to family life on a luxurious estate. But gradually, their marriage became a nightmare.... In this gripping account of Cheryl's murder, Ann Rule takes us from Brad's troubled boyhood to one of the most bizarre trials in legal history, uncovering multiple marriages, financial manipulations, infidelities, and monstrous acts of harassment and revenge along the way.

1311,Eric Schlosser,"A groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.Are we what we eat? To a degree both engrossing and alarming, the story of fast food is the story of postwar America. Though created by a handful of mavericks, the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape, widened the chasm between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad. That's a lengthy list of charges, but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning. Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast food's flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold America's most dangerous job -- meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers' convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations. Along the way, Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains' efforts to reel in the youngest, most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization -- a phenomenon launched by fast food. Fast Food Nation is a groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,399,3.74,190528,5242,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,Nonfiction|Food and Drink|Food|Health|Sociology|Politics,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388181135l/1097.jpg,399,,,,,,,,,

But Tsuna's life takes a dramatic turn when Reborn, a suit-wearing, gun-toting baby who claims to be an Italian hit man, shows up at his house. Reborn was sent to Japan to groom Tsuna for his future life as a big Mafia boss. Tsuna doesn't believe this absurd story, so Reborn shoots Tsuna in the head with his gun.

After five minutes, Tsuna goes back to normal. Reborn explains how his gun works: when he shoots a person in the head, if that person has regrets about her life, then she will die and be reborn, temporarily endowed with special powers that enable her to fix or solve whatever is the source of her regret. (If Reborn shoots someone who is free of regret, she would die.)Tsuna becomes Reborn's disciple, and because Reborn shoots Tsuna in the head all the time, he is constantly being reborn and growing into a stronger and better person, gradually impressing those around him and making friends.---Taken from back cover:HERE COMES REBORN!Junior high student Tsuna is a failure at school, sports, and social life.

An elderly Russian woman now living in America, she cannot hold on to fresh memories—the details of her grown children's lives, the approaching wedding of her grandchild—yet her distant past is miraculously preserved in her mind's eye.   Vivid images of her youth in war-torn Leningrad arise unbidden, carrying her back to the terrible fall of 1941, when she was a tour guide at the Hermitage Museum and the German army's approach signaled the beginning of what would be a long, torturous siege on the city. As the people braved starvation, bitter cold, and a relentless German onslaught, Marina joined other staff members in removing the museum's priceless masterpieces for safekeeping, leaving the frames hanging empty on the walls to symbolize the artworks' eventual return. As the Luftwaffe's bombs pounded the proud, stricken city, Marina built a personal Hermitage in her mind—a refuge that would stay buried deep within her, until she needed it once more. . . .

H recalls when he himself was sixteen—his godson’s age—as they search for the site of H’s life-altering friendship with a boy named Finn. Finn lives alone on an isolated slip of land and follows no rules: he spends his days swimming, fishing, and collecting driftwood for his tiny beach hut. H, on the other hand, is an upper-class boarding school boy stifled by monotony and endless rules. They meet by chance on the beach, and H is immediately awed by (and jealous of) Finn’s way of life.

14210,Charles Burns,"Suburban Seattle, the mid-1970s. We learn from the out-set that a strange plague has descended upon the area’s teenagers, transmitted by sexual contact. The disease is manifested in any number of ways — from the hideously grotesque to the subtle (and concealable) — but once you’ve got it, that’s it. There’s no turning back.As we inhabit the heads of several key characters — some kids who have it, some who don’t, some who are about to get it — what unfolds isn’t the expected battle to fight the plague, or bring heightened awareness to it , or even to treat it. What we become witness to instead is a fascinating and eerie portrait of the nature of high school alienation itself — the savagery, the cruelty, the relentless anxiety and ennui, the longing for escape.And then the murders start.As hypnotically beautiful as it is horrifying, Black Hole transcends its genre by deftly exploring a specific American cultural moment in flux and the kids who are caught in it- back when it wasn’t exactly cool to be a hippie anymore, but Bowie was still just a little too weird.

11314,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"The Insulted & Injured, published soon after Dostoevsky's political imprisonment, clearly foreshadows his later preoccupation with unconscious psychological drives & their external effects on the lives of his characters. Where his later works carry these drives to inevitably dramatic conclusions, The Insulted & Injured confines them within the smaller boundaries of everyday event. In this story the impulse toward self-abnegation in love, which appears so markedly in both Vanya & Natasha, isn't itself enough to direct their lives; instead, it combines with their social world & the mundane ambitions of Prince Valkovsky to defeat their hope of happiness. Of all the characters in the novel, only Natasha's lover, the Prince's son Alyosha-the person least driven to mold life to his own terms-emerges untouched. Here are, to a greater extent than in Dostoevsky's more familiar works, flesh-&-blood people as we see them around every day. They are made up of both good & evil, of will & acceptance. Unfailingly they command interest & illuminate understanding.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,460,4.22,11079,750,The Insulted and Humiliated,Classics|Cultural|Russia|Literature|Russian Literature|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347466262l/329803.jpg,460,,,,,,,,,

Though his beloved godfather, Murtagh, promised Jamie’s late parents he’d watch over their brash son, making good on that vow will be no easy task. There’s already a fat bounty on the young exile’s head, courtesy of Captain Black Jack Randall, the sadistic British officer who’s crossed paths—and swords—with Jamie in the past. And in the court of the mighty MacKenzie clan, Jamie is a pawn in the power struggle between his uncles: aging chieftain Colum, who demands his nephew’s loyalty—or his life—and Dougal, war chieftain of Clan MacKenzie, who’d sooner see Jamie put to the sword than anointed Colum’s heir.And then there is Claire Randall—mysterious, beautiful, and strong-willed, who appears in Jamie’s life to stir his  compassion . . . and arouse his desire.  But even as Jamie’s heart draws him to Claire, Murtagh is certain she’s been sent by the Old Ones, and Captain Randall accuses her of being a spy. Claire clearly has something to hide, though Jamie can’t believe she could pose him any danger. Still, he knows she is torn between two choices—a life with him, and whatever it is that draws her thoughts so often elsewhere.     Step into the captivating, passionate, and suspenseful world of The Exile, and experience the storytelling magic of Diana Gabaldon as never before.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,224,3.54,9974,1237,The Exile: An Outlander Graphic Novel,Historical|Historical Fiction|Sequential Art|Graphic Novels|Romance|Fantasy|Science Fiction|Time Travel|Historical,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1502465373l/7517343.jpg,224,,,,,,,,,

Award-winning journalist Mara Leveritt's The Devil's Knot remains the most comprehensive, insightful reporting ever done on the investigation, trials, and convictions of three teenage boys who became known as the West Memphis Three.For weeks in 1993, after the murders of three eight-year-old boys, police in West Memphis, Arkansas seemed stymied. Then suddenly, detectives charged three teenagers, alleged members of a satanic cult, with the killings. Despite the witch-hunt atmosphere of the trials, and a case which included stunning investigative blunders, a confession riddled with errors, and an absence of physical evidence linking any of the accused to the crime, the teenagers were convicted. Jurors sentenced Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley to life in prison and Damien Echols, the accused ringleader, to death. The guilty verdicts were popular in their home state, even upheld on appeal, and all three remained in prison until their unprecedented release in August 2011.With close-up views of its key participants, this award-winning account unravels the many tangled knots of this endlessly shocking case, one which will shape the American legal landscape for years to come.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,419,4.13,7617,648,Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three,Crime|True Crime|Nonfiction|Mystery|Crime|Mystery|History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400948609l/206899.jpg,419,,,,,,,,,

Chapters: Novels by Kate Chopin, Short Stories by Kate Chopin, Desiree's Baby, the Awakening, the Storm, the Story of an Hour, at the Cadian Ball. Source: Wikipedia. Free updates online. Not illustrated. Excerpt: Desirees Baby is a short story written by American author Kate Chopin about miscegenation in Creole Louisiana during the antebellum period. Desiree is the adopted daughter of Monsieur and Madame Valmonde, who are wealthy Creoles in Louisiana. As a baby, she was discovered by Monsieur Valmonde lying in the shadow of a stone pillar near the Valmonde gateway. She is courted by another wealthy scion of a Creole family, Armand. They appear very devoted to one another and eventually have a child. The people who see the baby get a sense that something is unusual about it. Eventually they realize that the baby's skin is the same color as the quadroon (one-quarter African) nursemaid - the baby is not white. At the time of the story, this would have been considered a terrible taint. Because of Desirees unknown origins, Armand immediately assumes that she is part Black, and after Madame Valmonde suggests that Desiree and the baby return to the Valmonde estate, Armand tells her to leave. Desiree then takes the child and walks off into a bayou where she is never seen again. Armand then proceeds to burn all of Desirees belongings and the childs cradle, as well as all of the letters that she had sent him during their courtship. With this bundle of letters is also one written from his mother to his father, revealing that Armand is in fact the one who is part black. Desiree's race is never definitively determined, although after she is dismissed: ""Moreover no longer loved her, because of the unconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name.""

41388,Jeffrey M. Schwartz|Sharon Begley,"A groundbreaking work of science that confirms, for the first time, the independent existence of the mind–and demonstrates the possibilities for human control over the workings of the brain.Conventional science has long held the position that 'the mind' is merely an illusion, a side effect of electrochemical activity in the physical brain. Now in paperback, Dr Jeffrey Schwartz and Sharon Begley's groundbreaking work, The Mind and the Brain, argues exactly the opposite: that the mind has a life of its own.Dr Schwartz, a leading researcher in brain dysfunctions, and Wall Street Journal science columnist Sharon Begley demonstrate that the human mind is an independent entity that can shape and control the functioning of the physical brain. Their work has its basis in our emerging understanding of adult neuroplasticity–the brain's ability to be rewired not just in childhood, but throughout life, a trait only recently established by neuroscientists.Through decades of work treating patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), Schwartz made an extraordinary finding: while following the therapy he developed, his patients were effecting significant and lasting changes in their own neural pathways. It was a scientific first: by actively focusing their attention away from negative behaviors and toward more positive ones, Schwartz's patients were using their minds to reshape their brains–and discovering a thrilling new dimension to the concept of neuroplasticity.The Mind and the Brain follows Schwartz as he investigates this newly discovered power, which he calls self–directed neuroplasticity or, more simply, mental force. It describes his work with noted physicist Henry Stapp and connects the concept of 'mental force' with the ancient practice of mindfulness in Buddhist tradition. And it points to potential new applications that could transform the treatment of almost every variety of neurological dysfunction, from dyslexia to stroke–and could lead to new strategies to help us harness our mental powers. Yet as wondrous as these implications are, perhaps even more important is the philosophical dimension of Schwartz's work. For the existence of mental force offers convincing scientific evidence of human free will, and thus of man's inherent capacity for moral choice.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,432,4.07,5429,152,The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force,Psychology|Science|Nonfiction|Biology|Neuroscience|Neuroscience|Brain|Philosophy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386925436l/3281.jpg,432,,,,,,,,,

His father, leading the wise and benevolent Council of Mages, protected and guided the citizens of the Golden City of the Bells. Young Mages in training--all men, for women were unfit to practice magic--memorized the intricate details of High Magic and aspired to seats on the council.Then he found the forbidden Books of Wild Magic--or did they find him? The three slim volumes woke Kellen to the wide world outside the City's isolating walls. Their Magic was not dead, strangled by rules and regulations. It felt like a living thing, guided by the hearts and minds of those who practiced it and benefited from it.Questioning everything he has known, Kellen discovers too many of the City's dark secrets. Banished, with the Outlaw Hunt on his heels, Kellen invokes Wild Magic--and finds himself running for his life with a unicorn at his side.Kellen's life changes almost faster than he can understand or accept. Rescued by a unicorn, healed by a female Wild Mage who knows more about Kellen than anyone outside the City should, meeting Elven royalty and Elven warriors, and plunged into a world where the magical beings he has learned about as abstract concepts are flesh and blood creatures-Kellen both revels in and fears his new freedom.Especially once he learns about Demons. He'd always thought they were another abstract concept-a stand-in for ultimate evil. But if centaurs and dryads are real, then Demons surely are as well. And the one thing all the Mages of the City agreed on was that practicing Wild Magic corrupted a Mage. Turned him into a Demon. Would that be Kellen's fate?Deep in Obsidian Mountain, the Demons are waiting. Since their defeat in the last great War, they've been biding their time, sowing the seeds of distrust and discontent between their human and Elven enemies. Very soon now, when the Demons rise to make war, there will be no alliance between High and Wild Magic to stand against them. And all the world will belong to the Endarkened.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",,ebook,9.78E+12,608,4.01,9990,334,The Outstretched Shadow,Fantasy|Fiction|Fantasy|Magic|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316128601l/8926934.jpg,608,,,,,,,,,
54145,Laura María Agustín,"This groundbreaking work explodes several myths: that selling sex is completely different from any other kind of work, that migrants who sell sex are passive victims, and that the multitude of people out to save them are without self-interest.Laura Agustín makes a passionate case against these stereotypes, arguing that the label 'trafficked' does not accurately describe migrants' lives and that the 'rescue industry' disempowers them. Based on extensive research amongst both migrants who sell sex and social helpers, Sex at the Margins provides a radical analysis. Frequently, says Agustín, migrants make rational choices to travel and work in the sex industry. Although they are treated as a marginalised group, they form part of the dynamic global economy.Both powerful and controversial, this book is essential reading for all those who want to understand the increasingly important relationship between sex markets, migration and the desire for social justice.-from the back cover",,Paperback,9.78E+12,248,4.08,142,13,"Sex at the Margins: Migration, Labour Markets and the Rescue Industry",Sexuality|Sex Work|Nonfiction|Feminism|Sociology|Sexuality|Anthropology|Politics,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344318057l/2088519.jpg,248,,,,,,,,,

Tyler Johnson, THE HOLLYWOOD GOSSIP This compelling and true life story screams of betrayal, deceit, and an unsolved mystery. It began when a budding young woman was lured into a cunning and deceptive scheme which eventually became her undoing. The tale may have gone unnoticed under normal circumstances. However, the plot thickened when a famous celebrity, Bill Cosby, was the target of a greedy rouse. The timing couldn’t have been worse as it fell on the heels of his son's murder. Ennis Cosby had been shot and killed the day an alleged extortion letter was delivered to the comedian demanding millions in hush money. During one of the most infamous trials of 1997 Cosby would face his adversary Autumn Jackson, and rue the day that she was born. Jackson could do nothing more than look into her father's eyes and weep for all that had never been. At least she believed the entertainer to be her father. This complicated and twisted saga is fraught with criminal and passion driven psychology. Who were the guilty ones and who were the innocents? “I’m Autumn Jackson’s aunt. I was called on to be her traveling companion, confidant, and unlikely bodyguard. When people asked me what happened, the answer was complicated.

5313,Baruch Spinoza|Edwin M. Curley|Stuart Hampshire|Edwin Curley,"A profoundly beautiful and uniquely insightful description of the universe, Benedict de Spinoza's Ethics is one of the masterpieces of Enlightenment-era philosophy. This Penguin Classics edition is edited and translated from the Latin by Edwin Curley, with an introduction by Stuart Hampshire.Published shortly after his death, the Ethics is undoubtedly Spinoza's greatest work - an elegant, fully cohesive cosmology derived from first principles, providing a coherent picture of reality, and a guide to the meaning of an ethical life. Following a logical step-by-step format, it defines in turn the nature of God, the mind, the emotions, human bondage to the emotions, and the power of understanding - moving from a consideration of the eternal, to speculate upon humanity's place in the natural order, the nature of freedom and the path to attainable happiness. A powerful work of elegant simplicity, the Ethics is a brilliantly insightful consideration of the possibility of redemption through intense thought and philosophical reflection.The Ethics is presented in the standard translation of the work by Edwin Curley. This edition also includes an introduction by Stuart Hampshire, outlining Spinoza's philosophy and placing it in context.Baruch Spinoza (1632-77), later known as Benedict de Spinoza, was born in Amsterdam, where his orthodox Jewish family had fled from persecution in Portugal. Ethics was published in 1677 after his death, and his influence spread to the nineteenth century: inspiring the Romantic poets, winning the respect of Flaubert and Matthew Arnold, and moving George Eliot, who admired him as the enemy of superstition and the hero of scientific rationalism, to begin a translation of his works.If you enjoyed Ethics, you might like Rene Descartes' Meditations and Other Metaphysical Writings, also available in Penguin Classics.'The noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers ... ethically he is supreme'Bertrand Russell",,Paperback,9.78E+12,186,4.02,10908,310,Ethics,Philosophy|Nonfiction|Classics|Religion|Literature|17th Century|Literature|Jewish|Psychology|Philosophy|Theory|Philosophy|Metaphysics|Unfinished,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1462223700l/205218.jpg,186,,,,,,,,,

19239,Sally Denton,"In September 1857, a wagon train passing through Utah laden with gold was attacked. Approximately 140 people were slaughtered; only 17 children under the age of eight were spared. This incident in an open field called Mountain Meadows has ever since been the focus of passionate debate: Is it possible that official Mormon dignitaries were responsible for the massacre? In her riveting book, Sally Denton makes a fiercely convincing argument that they were.The author–herself of Mormon descent–first traces the extraordinary emergence of the Mormons and the little-known nineteenth-century intrigues and tensions between their leaders and the U.S. government, fueled by the Mormons’ zealotry and exclusionary practices. We see how by 1857 they were unique as a religious group in ruling an entire American territory, Utah, and commanding their own exclusive government and army. Denton makes clear that in the immediate aftermath of the massacre, the church began placing the blame on a discredited Mormon, John D. Lee, and on various Native Americans. She cites contemporaneous records and newly discovered documents to support her argument that, in fact, the Mormon leader, Brigham Young, bore significant responsibility–that Young, impelled by the church’s financial crises, facing increasingly intense scrutiny and condemnation by the federal government, incited the crime by both word and deed.Finally, Denton explains how the rapidly expanding and enormously rich Mormon church of today still struggles to absolve itself of responsibility for what may well be an act of religious fanaticism unparalleled in the annals of American history. American Massacre is totally absorbing in its narrative as it brings to life a tragic moment in our history.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,352,3.96,444,54,"American Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857",History|Nonfiction|Religion|Lds|Mormonism|North American Hi...|American History|Crime|True Crime,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320451442l/539185.jpg,352,,,,,,,,,

Matthew Pearl's spellbinding new novel transports readers to tumultuous nineteenth-century Boston, where the word ""technology"" represents a bold and frightening new concept. The fight for the future will hinge on... The Technologists Boston, 1868. The Civil War may be over but a new war has begun, one between the past and the present, tradition and technology. On a former marshy wasteland, the daring Massachusetts Institute of Technology is rising, its mission to harness science for the benefit of all and to open the doors of opportunity to everyone of merit. But in Boston Harbor a fiery cataclysm throws commerce into chaos, as ships' instruments spin inexplicably out of control. Soon after, another mysterious catastrophe devastates the heart of the city. Is it sabotage by scientific means or Nature revolting against man's attempt to control it? The shocking disasters cast a pall over M.I.T. and provoke assaults from all sides - rival Harvard, labor unions, and a sensationalistic press. With their first graduation and the very survival of their groundbreaking college now in doubt, a band of the Institute's best and brightest students secretly come together to save innocent lives and track down the truth, armed with ingenuity and their unique scientific training. Led by ""charity scholar"" Marcus Mansfield, a quiet Civil War veteran and one-time machinist struggling to find his footing in rarefied Boston society, the group is rounded out by irrepressible Robert Richards, the bluest of Beacon Hill bluebloods; Edwin Hoyt, class genius; and brilliant freshman Ellen Swallow, the Institute's lone, ostracized female student. Working against their small secret society, from within and without, are the arrayed forces of a stratified culture determined to resist change at all costs and a dark mastermind bent on the utter destruction of the city. Studded with suspense and soaked in the rich historical atmosphere for which its author is renowned, The Technologists is a dazzling journey into a dangerous world not so very far from our own, as the America we know today begins to shimmer into being.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,480,3.5,3241,646,The Technologists,Historical|Historical Fiction|Mystery|Fiction|Thriller|Historical,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1329873359l/11936279.jpg,480,,,,,,,,,

O romance se tornou um enorme sucesso, vindo a ser o primeiro grande livro sobre o conflito e a independência angolanos e uma referência histórica obrigatória.Numa narrativa não-linear e fragmentada, Lobo Antunes revela as inquietações existenciais de um ser humano, na indelével experiência de uma guerra, que se misturam às memórias de infância e juventude na Lisboa salazarista.O autor utiliza-se, na maior parte do romance, do fluxo de consciência e da associação de idéias, para construir a história e o perfil de seu narrador-protagonista, um personagem que, a partir de ""uma dolorosa aprendizagem da agonia"", vê sua vida e seus valores estilhaçados pela melancolia. O que lhe resta são fragmentos de memória - a criança que visitava com os pais o jardim zoológico aos domingos, o jovem que assiste impassível a seu futuro sendo traçado pela autoridade inquestionável de uma família salazarista, o adulto apático e frustrado diante da violência que lhe retira as rédeas e o sentido da vida.O leitor vai estar frente a frente com ""decadência, putrefação, pestilência e morte.

46886,John Grant Fuller Jr.,"This is the strange, true, almost incredible story of a small French village where in '51 hundreds of townspeople went mad on a single night. Many of the most highly regarded citizens leaped from windows or jumped into the Rhone, screaming that their heads were made of copper, their bodies wrapped in snakes, their limbs swollen to gigantic size or shrunken to tiny appendages. Others ran through the streets, claiming to be chased by ""bandits with donkey ears"", by tigers, lions & other terrifying apparitions. Animals went berserk. Dogs ripped bark from trees until their teeth fell out. Cats dragged themselves along the floor in grotesque contortions. Ducks strutted like penguins. Villagers & animals died right & left.  Bit by bit, the story behind the tragedy in Pont-St-Esprit--a tiny Provencial village of twisted streets that looks much today as it did in the Middle Ages--unfolded to doctors & toxcologists. That story, one of the most bizarre in modern medical history, is movingly recounted in The Day of St. Anthony's Fire. Throughout the Middle Ages & during other times in history, similar hallucinatory outbreaks occurred. They were called St. Anthony's Fire because it was believed that only prayers to the saint could hold the disease in check.  Even modern medicine could find no way to check the disease. Drugs failed to bring even temporary relief. Hundreds in the village suffered for weeks, with total agonizing insomnia, never knowing when they might once more suddenly go berserk.  The cause of St. Anthony's Fire was known since early history to be ergot, a mold found on rye grain that at rare times inexplicably became posionous enough to create monstrous hallucinations & death. In '51 little significance was attached to the fact that the base of ergot was lysergic acid, also the base for LSD, a drug just coming to the attention of scientists at the time--a drug so powerful that one eye-dropperful could cause as many as 5000 people to hallucinate for hours. At this point, the story becomes a vividly absorbing medical detective story demonstrating the possibility that a strange, spontaneous form of LSD might have caused the human tragedy that came to the hapless villagers of Pont-St-Esprit.",,Hardcover,,310,4.16,99,18,The Day of St. Anthony's Fire,History|Nonfiction|Medical,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435257919l/3058370.jpg,310,,,,,,,,,

Nel Sud caldo e opulento, sul Trono di Spade siede Robert Baratheon, irruente e impulsivo sovrano. La lunga pace che ha accompagnato il suo regno sta per finire: forze minacciose vanno schierandosi in campo. Il re è costretto ad allearsi con il signore del Nord, Eddard Stark, per fronteggiare i nemici, sopra a tutti la famiglia più ricca dei Sette Regni, i Lannister, che coltiva ambizioni grandiose e ordisce macchinazioni segrete per impossessarsi del Trono di Spade. Accecati dalle passioni, mossi da odi nascosti e risentimenti mai sopiti, gli avversari si combattono senza capire che il vero nemico, la più autentica minaccia, è altrove. Dall'estremo Nord infatti premono tribù ostili, animali primordiali e soprattutto gli Estranei, esseri misteriosi che odiano la vita, il calore, il fuoco e l'estate e che attaccano i Guardiani della notte, custodi della Barriera, una muraglia ciclopica eretta per difendere i Sette Regni.

38367,Daniel Glattauer,"Zuerst die gute Nachricht: Emmi und Leo sind wieder da! Und jetzt die schlechte Nachricht: Es sieht so aus, als wäre ihre zauberhafte Geschichte mit diesem Band zu einem endgültigen Ende gebracht. Obwohl – man weiß ja nie ... Aber der Reihe nach: 2006 veröffentlichte Daniel Glattauer jenen ungewöhnlichen Liebesroman Gut gegen Nordwind, der einschlug wie eine Bombe: Die Geschichte einer Liebe zwischen einem Mann und einer Frau, die in zufälligen E-Mail-Kontakt geraten und dann von dem, was der jeweils andere schreibt, so eingenommen sind, dass sie voneinander nicht mehr lassen können (und das, ohne sich je zu begegnen), wurde ein Sensationserfolg. Und die Leser, süchtig geworden nach Glattauers virtuosem E-Mail-Stakkato, konnten, als sie die letzte Seite des Buches umschlugen, kaum fassen, dass das Vergnügen schon vorbei sein sollte – und dass die Geschichte dieses unerwartete, einem Schlag in die Magengrube gleichkommende Ende nahm. Tja, doch das Ende war kein Ende. Ein knappes Jahr nach dem furiosen Finale von Gut gegen Nordwind kehrt Leo aus Boston zurück, wohin er quasi geflohen war. Emmi hat in der Zwischenzeit immer wieder versucht, ihn zu kontaktieren, doch zu mehr als einem (köstlichen!) „Dialog“ mit den automatisch generierten Antwortmails des Systemadministrators war es nicht gekommen. Aber plötzlich ist Leo wieder da – und antwortet. Und obwohl sie es beide eigentlich nicht möchten (oder doch?), obwohl jeder in der Zwischenzeit sein Leben ohne den anderen einzurichten versucht hat (Leo hat sogar eine Freundin, allerdings in Boston ...), sind sie sich so schnell wieder so nah, dass aus „Ich“ und „Du“ ein „Wir“ wird. Schon wieder. Und diesmal kommt es zur Begegnung. Mit turbulenten Folgen.  Alle sieben Wellen reicht nicht ganz an Gut gegen Nordwind heran. Ein kleines bisschen Esprit ist verlorengegangen, vielleicht ist man von der Grundidee auch nicht mehr überrascht genug, um sich derart ins Geschehen hineinziehen zu lassen wie beim Vorgänger. Dennoch ist Alle sieben Wellen ein echter Pageturner, der wieder eine Fülle an überraschenden Wendungen bereithält – bis hin zu einem ähnlich umwerfenden Schluss-Clou wie im ersten Band. Und wieder scheint dieses Ende final zu sein – doch das hat man beim ersten Band ja auch gedacht ...  -- Christoph Nettersheim",,,,400,3.8,9025,805,Emmi & Leo,Romance|Fiction|Contemporary|European Literature|German Literature|Womens Fiction|Chick Lit,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411822180l/23275875.jpg,400,,,,,,,,,

Daphne Bleau (that’s right, like the color) is not the kind to be tricked easily. She’s conservative, boring, and has a tremendous fear of trying anything new and exciting. She’s also brilliant, but her consideration and concern for her mischievous cousin causes her to fall for another one of her cousin’s antics. But this time, her cousin is caught up in something different . . . The Tesoro project is one that requires solving difficult riddles and puzzles in order to track down artifacts left behind by a dangerous pirate group known as Tesoro who lived back in the late 1600s. What starts off as more of a leisure activity ultimately takes over and seems to permanently captivate whoever joins in on the search, making the people involved take extreme measures to stay ahead of each other. The clues start off simple, and gradually become more dangerous. By the end, their lives are at stake. To make matters more complicated, Daphne and her teammates have run into an uncle who has been almost completely absent for the past fifteen years. Her family has been secretive of the reasoning behind his whereabouts. The story begins in the beautiful Hamptons and unexpectedly transitions to Rome, Italy.

Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: ""Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,274,3.97,363457,9187,Ella Enchanted,Fantasy|Young Adult|Fiction|Romance|Fantasy|Fairy Tales|Childrens,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1167521378l/24336.jpg,274,,,,,,,,,

48043,Paul Adams|Peter Underwood|Eddie Brazil,"Borley Rectory in Essex, built in 1862, should have been an ordinary Victorian clergyman's house. However, just a year after its construction, unexplained footsteps were heard within the house, and from 1900 until it burned down in 1939 numerous paranormal phenomena, including phantom coaches and shattering windows, were observed. In 1929 the house was investigated by the ""Daily Mail"" and paranormal researcher Harry Price, and it was he who called it 'the most haunted house in England'. Price also took out a lease of the rectory from 1937 to 1938, recruiting forty-eight 'official observers' to monitor occurences. After his death in 1948, the water was muddied by claims that Price's findings were not genuine paranormal activity, and ever since there has been a debate over what really went on at Borley Rectory.

In the retelling, Olympus becomes small-town Olinger High School; Chiron is George Caldwell, a science teacher there; and Prometheus is Caldwell’s fifteen-year-old son, Peter. Brilliantly conflating the author’s remembered past with tales from Greek mythology, John Updike translates Chiron’s agonized search for relief into the incidents and accidents of three winter days spent in rural Pennsylvania in 1947.

While the location she now calls home is a dangerous place, she is protected by an unlikely friendship.The streets provided her with the education she could've never earned from the prestigious university she attended.

9444,Christopher  Ryan|Cacilda Jethá,"Since Darwin's day, we've been told that sexual monogamy comes naturally to our species. Mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages.How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá. While debunking almost everything we ""know"" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book.Ryan and Jethá's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity.With intelligence, humor, and wonder, Ryan and Jethá show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy, sexual orientation, and family dynamics. They explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality.In the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing, Sex at Dawn unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,400,4.03,17870,1867,Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality,Nonfiction|Science|History|Sexuality|Psychology|Anthropology,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1291105594l/7640261.jpg,400,,,,,,,,,
19380,Émile Zola,"La Goutte d'Or es el escenario en esta obra de Zola, séptima entrega del ciclo narrativo de los Rougon-Macquart, centrada exclusivamente en el proletariado. Los problemas que abundan en los suburbios de la capital, incluso a aquellos que prueban a ganarse la vida con honradez, son los que acechan a Gervaise Maquart y los suyos: el embrutecimiento producido por el consumo excesivo de alcohol, la miseria, la falta de formación y empleo, que enturbian el ambiente de las calles del barrio. Una mañana, Gervaise espera la llegada de Lantier, su pareja, ausente toda la noche, sin embargo, cuando esta se produce, no es para que la normalidad siga su curso, si no para cambiar por completo el rumbo de su existencia. Abandonada, sin trabajo y cargando a dos hijos, se verá obligada a buscar una pronta solución que evite su caída en la miseria. Pronto el cinquero Coupeau, vecino de ella, e interesado desde hace tiempo en la joven, se materializará como la necesaria alternativa. Pero, con el paso de los años, tanto el destino como la gente que les rodean, amenazan con romper su equilibrio a pesar de su buena disposición y su inclinación por la bondad y la honestidad. La taberna (1877) cumple con el primordial objetivo de Zola, ""dar al lector un fragmento de la vida humana,"" fragmento en el que el alcoholismo, la haraganería, la promiscuidad, la vergüenza y la muerte sirven para presentar a su protagonista como la heroína de una ""moral en acción.""",Letras Universales,Paperback,9.79E+12,512,4.06,10384,432,La Taberna,Classics|Fiction|Cultural|France|European Literature|French Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1471727561l/956764.jpg,512,,,,,,,,,

Moving from her earliest memories of the walled gardens and rocky shores of Western Ireland and her Hollywood childhood to her career as an actress, she writes of these experiences and her struggle to protect her children in a painful custody battle with Woody Allen. It was the crisis that led her to reflect upon the incidents that had brought her to a place so incomprehensible. She was born the third of seven children to the beautiful actress Maureen O'Sullivan and successful writer/director John Farrow, but the isolation of a polio ward brought her childhood to an abrupt end at the age of nine. Several years later, two deaths shattered the security of the family forever, and Mia Farrow embarked upon a journey that would lead her away from the convent education that was to sustain her spiritual courage, to starring roles in Peyton Place and Rosemary's Baby, a marriage to Frank Sinatra, divorce, a defining trip to India, work on the London stage and in film, and marriage to Andre Previn. Their life together in England brought them three sons and three daughters before that marriage, too, dissolved and she returned to the United States. The year 1979 saw the beginning of a new career with brilliant performances in thirteen of Woody Allen's most distinguished films.",,Mass Market Paperback,9.78E+12,352,3.89,1245,108,What Falls Away: A Memoir,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography|Biography|Autobiography|Biography Memoir,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1223664315l/448797.jpg,352,,,,,,,,,

12048,Gabriel García Márquez|Seçkin Selvi,"""Yüzyıllık Yalnızlık'ı yazmaya başladığımda, çocukluğumda beni etkilemiş olan her şeyi edebiyat aracılığıyla aktarabileceğim bir yol bulmak istiyordum. Çok kasvetli, kocaman bir evde, toprak yiyen bir kızkardeş, geleceği sezen bir büyükanne ve mutlulukla çılgınlık arasında ayrım gözetmeyen, adları birörnek bir yığın akraba arasında geçen çocukluk günlerimi sanatsal bir dille ardımda bırakmaktı amacım. Yüzyıllık Yalnızlık'ı iki yıldan daha az bir sürede yazdım. Ama yazı makinemin başına oturmadan önce bu kitap hakkında düşünmek on beş, on altı yılımı aldı... Büyükannem, en acımasız şeyleri, kılını bile kıpırdatmadan, sanki yalnızca gördüğü şeylermiş gibi anlatırdı bana. Anlattığı öyküleri bu kadar değerli kılan şeyin, onun duygusuz tavrı ve imgelerindeki zenginlik olduğunu kavradım. Yüzyıllık Yalnızlık'ı büyükannemin işte bu yöntemini kullanarak yazdım... Bu romanı büyük bir dikkatle ve keyifle okuyan ve hiç şaşırmayan sıradan insanlar tanıdım. Şaşırmadılar, çünkü ben onlara hayatlarında yeni olan hiçbir şey anlatmamıştım.

Drafted by Thomas Jefferson, the Declaration set forth the terms of a new form of government with the following words: ""We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.""Framed in 1787 and in effect since March 1789, the Constitution of the United States of America fulfilled the promise of the Declaration by establishing a republican form of government with separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, became part of the Constitution on December 15, 1791. Among the rights guaranteed by these amendments are freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and the right to trial by jury. Written so that it could be adapted to endure for years to come, the Constitution has been amended only seventeen times since 1791 and has lasted longer than any other written form of government.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,112,4.45,18447,292,The Declaration of Independence and The Constitution of the United States,History|Nonfiction|Politics|Classics|Philosophy|Reference,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320508156l/285500.jpg,112,,,,,,,,,

And the story he has to tell is a truly disturbing—yet strangely heartwarming—one.Convinced he'll bring about a peaceful coexistence between zombies and humans if he can demonstrate his unique condition to Howard Stein, the man responsible for the zombie virus, Barnes sets off on a grueling cross-country journey to meet his maker. Along the way he recruits a small army of ""super"" zombies that will stop at nothing to reach their goal. There's Guts, the dreadlocked boy who can run like the wind; Joan, the matronly nurse adept at reattaching decaying appendages; Annie, the young girl with a fierce quick-draw; and Ros, who can actually speak. United they embark on an epic quest to attain what all men, women—and, apparently, zombies—yearn for: equality.Brains is a blood-soaked, darkly humorous story that will have readers rooting for Barnes and his zombie posse to the very end.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,182,3.54,2150,280,Brains: A Zombie Memoir,Horror|Zombies|Horror|Fiction|Humor,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1268604740l/7093421.jpg,182,,,,,,,,,

It tells the story of Jill Kinmont, a talented downhill skier whose Olympic success was imminent until a terrible fall in Utah rendered her a quadriplegic. But the true success of this book lies not with the representation of Jill Kinmont as a tragic heroine, but with the portrayal of her as someone whose commitment, dedication, drive, and determination have enabled her to succeed at life, despite the tremendous obstacles she has faced. Her skiing ability is legendary, but it is as a person she stands tall. Her story proves beyond all doubt than when our bodies are at their weakest our spirits are at their strongest.This is an amazing and memorable piece of work and will be cherished by those who believe in the immortality and infallibility of the human spirit.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,352,3.89,1085,36,The Other Side of the Mountain: The Story of Jill Kinmont,Biography|Nonfiction|Biography Memoir|Autobiography|Memoir|Disability,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1433550992l/129808.jpg,352,,,,,,,,,
12239,Miriam Toews,"Miriam Toews is beloved for her irresistible voice, for mingling laughter and heartwrenching poignancy like no other writer. In her most passionate novel yet, she brings us the riveting story of two sisters, and a love that illuminates life. You won’t forget Elf and Yoli, two smart and loving sisters. Elfrieda, a world-renowned pianist, glamorous, wealthy, happily married: she wants to die. Yolandi, divorced, broke, sleeping with the wrong men as she tries to find true love: she desperately wants to keep her older sister alive. Yoli is a beguiling mess, wickedly funny even as she stumbles through life struggling to keep her teenage kids and mother happy, her exes from hating her, her sister from killing herself and her own heart from breaking.  But Elf’s latest suicide attempt is a shock: she is three weeks away from the opening of her highly anticipated international tour. Her long-time agent has been calling and neither Yoli nor Elf’s loving husband knows what to tell him. Can she be nursed back to “health” in time? Does it matter? As the situation becomes ever more complicated, Yoli faces the most terrifying decision of her life. All My Puny Sorrows, at once tender and unquiet, offers a profound reflection on the limits of love, and the sometimes unimaginable challenges we experience when childhood becomes a new country of adult commitments and responsibilities. In her beautifully rendered new novel, Miriam Toews gives us a startling demonstration of how to carry on with hope and love and the business of living even when grief loads the heart.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,321,3.94,15867,2183,All My Puny Sorrows,Fiction|Cultural|Canada|Contemporary|Literary Fiction|Novels,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1416181263l/18339630.jpg,321,,,,,,,,,

52594,Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy,"Tolstoi published two science fiction novels, both of which appeared in the experimental 1920s and which were revised during the following decades of Stalinist terror. Aelita (1923) is a science-fiction fantasy in the manner of H.G. Wells, telling the story of a Soviet expedition to Mars with the aim of establishing communism. A Red Army officer forments a rebellion of the native Martians, who are in fact long-ago emigrants from Atlantis. The story was adapted into a screen play in 1924. Its futuristic, expressionistic sets were designed by Isaac Rabinovitch of the Kamerny Theatre.

13438,David Starkey,"No one in history had a more eventful career in matrimony than Henry VIII. His marriages were daring and tumultuous, and made instant legends of six very different women. In this remarkable study, David Starkey argues that the king was not a depraved philanderer but someone seeking happiness -- and a son. Knowingly or not, he elevated a group of women to extraordinary heights and changed the way a nation was governed.Six Wives is a masterful work of history that intimately examines the rituals of diplomacy, marriage, pregnancy, and religion that were part of daily life for women at the Tudor Court. Weaving new facts and fresh interpretations into a spellbinding account of the emotional drama surrounding Henry's six marriages, David Starkey reveals the central role that the queens played in determining policy. With an equally keen eye for romantic and political intrigue, he brilliantly recaptures the story of Henry's wives and the England they ruled.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,880,4.13,8703,302,Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII,History|Nonfiction|Biography|English History|Tudor Period|Historical,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407707679l/134961.jpg,880,,,,,,,,,

And for the first time, Peabody is primary detective on the case, which means she has to get used to a new level of authority and responsibility. Good thing she learned the ropes from a master like Eve.But after rounding up the perps, Peabody stumbles upon a much trickier situation. Determined to start working out as hard as she grills suspects, she chooses to do it at the old, rarely-used gym at Central. After a grueling workout, she squeezes into one of the narrow shower stalls, happy to have the place to herself. Just after she shuts the water off, the gym door clatters open — and while she cringes inside the stall, trying not to make a sound, Peabody overhears two fellow officers, Garnet and Oberman, arguing. References are made to delivering product, and a house in the islands, and someone named Keener who’s supposed to look like an OD. It doesn’t take long for a naked and vulnerable Peabody to realize that both officers are crooked — guilty not just of corruption but of murder as well. Fortunately, the two clear out of the locker room without realizing there was a witness.Eve Dallas may have trained Peabody well — but this is too dangerous for one person to take on alone. Now Peabody, Eve, and her husband, Roarke, must try to get the hard evidence they need to bring the dirty cops down — knowing all the while that the two have already killed to keep their secret, and are no doubt willing to do it again.11 Audio CDs / 13 Hours 14 mins ~",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,375,4.44,21772,1185,Treachery in Death,Mystery|Romance|Romance|Romantic Suspense,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440092413l/8315872.jpg,375,,,,,,,,,

A Pulitzer Prize-winner for his ground-breaking reporting on the Vietnam War, Halberstam wrote more than 20 books, almost all of them bestsellers. His work has stood the test of time and has become the standard by which all journalists measure themselves.""In the firehouse, the men not only live and eat with each other, they play sports together, go off to drink together, help repair one another's houses, and, most important, share terrifying risks; their loyalties to each other must, by the demands of the dangers they face, be instinctive and absolute.""So writes David Halberstam, one of America's most distinguished reporters and historians, in this stunning New York Times bestselling book about Engine 40, Ladder 35, located on the West Side of Manhattan near Lincoln Center. On the morning of September 11, 2001, two rigs carrying thirteen men set out from this firehouse: twelve of them would never return.Firehouse takes us to the epicenter of the tragedy. Through the kind of intimate portraits that are Halberstam's trademark, we watch the day unfold--the men called to duty while their families wait anxiously for news of them. In addition, we come to understand the culture of the firehouse itself: why gifted men do this; why, in so many instances, they are eager to follow in their fathers' footsteps and serve in so dangerous a profession; and why, more than anything else, it is not just a job, but a calling.This is journalism-as-history at its best, the story of what happens when one small institution gets caught in an apocalyptic day.

12254,Laura Bates,"Women are standing up and #shoutingback. In a culture that's driven by social media, for the first time women are using this online space (@EverydaySexism www.everydaysexism.com) to come together, share their stories and encourage a new generation to recognise the problems that women face. This book is a call to arms in a new wave of feminism and it proves sexism is endemic - socially, politically and economically. But women won't stand for it. The Everyday Sexism Project is grounded in reality; packed with substance, validity and integrity it shows that women will no longer tolerate a society that ignores the dangers and endless effects of sexism.  In 2012 after being sexually harassed on London public transport Laura Bates, a young journalist, started a project called Everyday Sexism to collect stories for a piece she was writing on the issue. Astounded by the response she received and the wide range of stories that came pouring in from all over the world, she quickly realised that the situation was far worse than she'd initially thought. Enough was enough. From being leered at and wolf-whistled on the street, to aggravation in the work place and serious sexual assault, it was clear that sexism had been normalised. Bates decided it was time for change.  This bold, jaunty and ultimately intelligent book is the first to give a collective online voice to the protest against sexism. This game changing book is a juggernaut of stories, often shocking, sometimes amusing and always poignant - it is a must read for every inquisitive, no-nonsense modern woman.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,384,4.38,5306,651,Everyday Sexism,Nonfiction|Feminism|Politics,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1394425595l/21251323.jpg,384,,,,,,,,,

32181,Rachel de Queiroz,"Publicado em 1930, o romance O Quinze, de Rachel de Queiroz, renovou a ficção regionalista. Possui cenas e episódios característicos da região, com a procissão de pedir chuva, são traços descritivos da condição do retirante. O sentido reivindicatório, entretanto não traz soluções prontas, preferindo apontar os males da região através de observação narrativa.Em O Quinze, primeiro e mais popular romance de Rachel de Queiroz, a autora exprime intensa preocupação social, apoiada, contudo, na análise psicológica das personagens, especialmente o homem nordestino, sob pressão de forças atávicas que o impelem à aceitação fatalista do destino. Há uma tomada de posição temática da seca, do coronelismo e dos impulsos passionais, em que o psicológico se harmoniza com o social.A obra apresenta a seca do nordeste e a fome como conseqüência, não trazendo ou tentando dar uma lição, mas como imagem da vida. Não percebe-se uma total separação entre ricos e pobres, e esta fusão é feita através da personagem Conceição que pertence realmente aos dois mundos. Evitando assim o perigo dos romances sociais na divisão entre ""bons pobres"" e ""maus ricos"", não condicionando inocentes ou culpados.",,,,149,3.91,726,33,O Quinze,Classics|Fiction|Cultural|Brazil|European Literature|Portuguese Literature|Adult|Contemporary|Romance|Womens|Historical|Historical Fiction|Cultural|Latin American,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1235735678l/6295876.jpg,149,,,,,,,,,

Arjuna represents the human soul seated in the chariot of the body and Krishna is the inner Spirit, the God within, who is there to counsel him.

42635,Roy  Lewis|Terry Pratchett|Carlo Brera,"«Il libro che avete fra le mani è uno dei più divertenti degli ultimi cinquecentomila anni» ha scritto Terry Pratchett. È vero, tanto tempo è passato, da quando vissero Ernest, il narratore di questo libro, con la sua ingegnosa famiglia, dal padre Edward, che fu senza dubbio «il più grande uomo scimmia del Pleistocene», a quell’amabile reazionario di zio Vania, che tornava sempre a vivere sugli alberi, a quel viaggiatore incallito dello zio Ian, per non parlare delle ragazze. Un curioso gruppetto, che si trovò, sotto la guida del grande Edward, nella delicata situazione di chi dà all’evoluzione una spinta che non si riequilibrerà mai: la spinta da cui siamo nati tutti noi. Ragionando con impeccabile acume scientifico, nonché un delizioso humour freddo, Edward e i suoi scoprirono «alcune delle cose più potenti e spaventose su cui la razza umana abbia mai messo le mani: il fuoco, la lancia, il matrimonio e così via», sempre sulla base di una elementare esigenza: quella di «cucinare senza essere cucinati e mangiare senza essere mangiati». E naturalmente non mancarono le dispute e i crucci, perché ogni volta si poteva discutere se quelle nuove invenzioni erano davvero buone o cattive, se non rischiavano di sfuggire al controllo e soprattutto se non andavano un po’ troppo contro la natura. Mah...Pubblicato per la prima volta nel 1960, e poi ripreso più volte sotto vari titoli, questo libro si è fatto strada silenziosamente fra i classici della fantascienza a ritroso. Ma in realtà è un libro inclassificabile: una riflessione romanzesca, acutissima e leggera, su tutta la storia dell’umanità, contrassegnata in ogni dettaglio da quella limpidezza e da quell’ironia che appartengono alla migliore tradizione letteraria e scientifica inglese. Quando Théodore Monod lesse questo libro, segnalò all’autore uno o due errori tecnici, subito aggiungendo «che non importavano un accidente, perché la lettura del libro l’aveva fatto ridere tanto che era caduto da un cammello nel bel mezzo del Sahara».",Gli Adelphi #182,Paperback,9.79E+12,178,3.7,3348,287,Il più grande uomo scimmia del Pleistocene,Fiction|Humor|Historical|Historical Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344463575l/4590678.jpg,178,,,,,,,,,
33645,Ian Sample,"In the early 1960s, three groups of physicists, working independently in different countries, stumbled upon an idea that would change physics and fuel the imagination of scientists for decades. That idea was the Higgs boson – to find it would be to finally understand the origins of mass – the last building block of life itself. Now, almost 50 years later, that particle has finally been discovered.Award-winning science writer Ian Sample weaves together the personal stories and intense rivalries of the teams of scientists behind the Higgs boson. Massive is a tale of grand ambition, trans-Atlantic competition, clashing egos and occasionally spectacular failures. From the giant particle colliders built to further the scientists' quest to the political fallout of budget blowouts, debates over whether the search might even destroy the universe, to the incredible discovery of the particle itself, this is an epic story of imagination, personal ambition, sub-atomic exploration and global significance.Whichever way you look at it, this story is massive.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,352,3.84,616,53,Massive: The Higgs Boson and the Greatest Hunt in Science: Updated Edition,Science|Nonfiction|Science|Physics|History|Science|Popular Science,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353033167l/16127265.jpg,352,,,,,,,,,
33624,Franz Kafka,"Die Entstehung dieses nicht vollendeten Werkes – vom Sommer 1914 bis zum Ableben des Autors im Juni 1924 – war von besonders prägnanten Phasen in Kafkas Leben gekennzeichnet. Im Juli 1914 fand die Auflösung der Verlobung mit Felice Bauer statt. Sowohl die Verlobung als auch die Entlobung waren für Kafka mit starken Schuldgefühlen verbunden. Eine abschließende Aussprache hierzu im Berliner Hotel Askanischer Hof in Anwesenheit von Freunden hatte Kafka als „Gerichtshof“ empfunden. Unmittelbar danach begann er mit der Arbeit zum Process. Der Erste Weltkrieg brach aus. Ab dem Herbst 1914 wohnte Kafka erstmals unabhängig von seinen Eltern in einem eigenen Zimmer. Seine Arbeit schritt zunächst gut voran, in zwei Monaten entstanden rund 200 Manuskriptseiten, kam aber – wie bei ihm häufig – bald zum Erliegen. Er beschäftigte sich nun u. a. mit der Erzählung In der Strafkolonie. Der Process entstand nicht in linearer Abfolge: Es lässt sich nachweisen, dass Kafka zuerst das Eingangs- und das Schlusskapitel niederschrieb, danach schrieb er an einzelnen Kapiteln parallel weiter. Anfang 1915 wurde der Roman dann unvollendet beiseitegelegt und nie vollendet. Kafka schrieb den Process in Hefte, die er auch für die Niederschrift anderer Texte verwendete. Diese Blätter hat er später herausgetrennt und sie nach Kapiteln und Fragmenten neu sortiert, ohne dabei eine bestimmte Reihenfolge der Teile festzulegen.

38025,Louis Bayard,"From the critically acclaimed author of Mr. Timothy comes an ingenious tale of murder and revenge, featuring a retired New York City detective and a young cadet named Edgar Allan Poe.At West Point Academy in 1830, the calm of an October evening is shattered by the discovery of a young cadet's body swinging from a rope just off the parade grounds. An apparent suicide is not unheard of in a harsh regimen like West Point's, but the next morning, an even greater horror comes to light. Someone has stolen into the room where the body lay and removed the heart.At a loss for answers and desperate to avoid any negative publicity, the Academy calls on the services of a local civilian, Augustus Landor, a former police detective who acquired some renown during his years in New York City before retiring to the Hudson Highlands for his health. Now a widower, and restless in his seclusion, Landor agrees to take on the case. As he questions the dead man's acquaintances, he finds an eager assistant in a moody, intriguing young cadet with a penchant for drink, two volumes of poetry to his name, and a murky past that changes from telling to telling. The cadet's name? Edgar Allan Poe.Impressed with Poe's astute powers of observation, Landor is convinced that the poet may prove useful—if he can stay sober long enough to put his keen reasoning skills to the task. Working in close contact, the two men—separated by years but alike in intelligence—develop a surprisingly deep rapport as their investigation takes them into a hidden world of secret societies, ritual sacrifices, and more bodies. Soon, however, the macabre murders and Landor's own buried secrets threaten to tear the two men and their newly formed friendship apart.A rich tapestry of fine prose and intricately detailed characters, The Pale Blue Eye transports readers into a labyrinth of the unknown that will leave them guessing until the very end.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,432,3.72,4109,521,The Pale Blue Eye,Mystery|Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Mystery|Historical Mystery|Thriller|Mystery Thriller,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1434047106l/110076.jpg,432,,,,,,,,,
5764,Sheri Reynolds,"Oprah Book Club® Selection, April 1997: Members of the Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind spend their days and nights serving the Lord and waiting for the Rapture--that moment just before the Second Coming of Christ when the saved will be lifted bodily to heaven and the damned will be left behind to face the thousand years of tribulation on earth. The tribulation, according to Grandpa Herman, founder of Fire and Brimstone, will be an ugly time: ""He said that we'd run out of food. That big bugs would chase us around and sting us with their tails . . . He said we'd turn on the faucet in the bathroom and find only blood running out . . . He said evil multitudes would come unto us and cut off our limbs, and that we wouldn't die . . . And then he'd say, 'But you don't have to be left behind. You can go straight to Heaven with all of God's special children if you'll only open your hearts to Jesus . . .'""  Such talk of damnation weighs heavy on the mind of Ninah Huff, the 15-year-old narrator of Sheri Reynolds's second novel, The Rapture of Canaan. To distract her from sinful thoughts about her prayer partner James, Ninah puts pecan shells in her shoes and nettles in her bed. But concentrating on the Passion of Jesus cannot, in the end, deter Ninah and James from their passion for each other, and the consequences prove both tragic and transforming for the entire community.  The Rapture of Canaan is a book about miracles, and in writing it, Reynolds has performed something of a miracle herself. Although the church's beliefs and practices may seem extreme (sleeping in an open grave, mortifying the flesh with barbed wire), its members are complex and profoundly sympathetic as they wrestle with the contradictions of Fire and Brimstone's theology, the temptations of the outside world, and the frailties of the human heart.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,320,3.81,31843,799,The Rapture of Canaan,Fiction|Religion,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442420479l/5180.jpg,320,,,,,,,,,

For most young couples, news of their unborn child's gender brings joyful anticipation. Not so for Isha Tilak and her husband, Nikhil. They already have a beloved daughter, but Nikhil's parents, hard-wired to favor male children above all, coldly reject little Priya at every turn. Vain and selfish, they see female grandchildren as burdens, and would just as soon never meet the one growing in Isha's belly. Even the obstetrician agrees, going so far as to suggest the unthinkable, throwing Nikhil into a rage--and changing Isha's life forever. . .When Nikhil is discovered brutally murdered, Isha is convinced it had something to do with his reaction to the doctor's hideous ""solution"" to their problem.

Born into a privileged class, Isha doesn't know the first thing about fending for herself, but to protect her precious daughters, she will learn.

Now a savior has come, the Dar Sala-at, a messiah promised by prophecy yet unlike anyone's expectations: within the body of a beautiful young woman is the mind and spirit of a unique Kundalan female who is joined in mystical partnership with the mind and spirit of Annon Ashera, a V'ornn male, the last survivor of a noble family. Together the two adolescents have matured and merged into a new joint identity. Now their common destiny, and Kundala's, is in their own hands.In Lustbader's richly imagined saga The Pearl, magic and science clash on an epic scale. As in the Midkemia novels of Raymond Feist, the juxtaposition shows that neither is inherently good or evil. It is the people using magic or science who give them meaning, and Lustbader has created people you will never forget: Riane, the Dar-Sala-at; Eleana, the woman she loves twice over; Kurgan, the V'ornn usurper who raped Eleana and sired her child; Marethyn Stogggul, Kurgan's defiant sister, an artist who joins the Kundalan resistance; Marethyn's lover, chief trader Sornnn SaTrryn, who secretly helps the resistance as well; and the fabulous Krystren, the Sarakkon woman from the mysterious southern continent, who comes north on a secret mission and will change the lives of everyone she meets.

18394,Donald Jans,"A Spokane college graduate searches for wealth and fame in LA but finds only a string of dead-end jobs and outlandish individuals in Jans’ witty debut drama.In 1987, Jack Fitzpatrick’s plans to be rich and famous are off to a good start. Beverly Hills talent agent Alain Michaels tells Jack that he can find him work as a model in California. But when the modeling gig doesn’t pan out, Jack’s more determined than ever to make it on his own instead of returning to Spokane. He stays with a friend and runs through a few temp jobs, finally finding success as a bond broker. Jack makes good money at bond firm Freedom Capital Markets, but he soon realizes that he wants to share it with someone. There are more pressing issues for Jack, however, once he finds himself behind bars. The author’s Bukowski-esque tale has an ordinary protagonist immersed in extraordinary circumstances. Jack’s escape from his Spokane roots, for instance, is sublimely epitomized by Mrs. Pohlkiss, an affluent neighbor who looks down on him and who’s immediately on his mind at the slightest sign of failure. Likewise, Jack, while certainly not naïve, is faced with obstacles he’s never considered—complacency or boredom with a job and a revolving door of co-workers, some of them friends who leave too soon and a shady few who are considerably less friendly. Jack’s nonchalant narration manages to take the bite out of the story’s darker bits, like the protagonist’s eventual arrest and incarceration, as well as the toilet humor. Other characters, too, have their comic moments: Noah’s wife, a millionaire by inheritance, still demands that her husband get a job. Jans wisely saves details about Jack’s dog until later in the story. The revelation comes about the time readers’ sympathy for the protagonist may be waning since he starts dating an Asian woman simply because he’s tired of having sex with white women. Jack’s goal continually changes throughout the novel—he wants fame, success, and maybe even a wife—but what he truly craves is finally answered in a satisfying coda that’s both over-the-top and a little endearing.An engrossing but tongue-in-cheek drama that, even at its most dramatic, will leave readers smiling.",,Kindle Edition,,203,4.38,1562,281,Freaks I've Met,Humor|Humor|Comedy|Literature|American|Fiction|Contemporary|Young Adult|Coming Of Age|Realistic Fiction|Academic|College|Classics|Cult Classics|Literary Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1425999748l/25113747.jpg,203,,,,,,,,,

16198,Rocky M. Mirza,"This objective and rigorous re-visiting of the history of the US as the world's super imperiaist and ""mock"" democracy comes at an opportune time. the book explains with logical integrity why the world is finally on the right path when it questions the true motives of Americans for invading Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Grenada, Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama, the Phiippines, Mexico, Canada and numerous other countries during its short history as a world power. Thos emotives, far from being its professed motives of spreading democracy and republican values, are those of military industrial complex determined to dominate the world and exploit its resources for the benefit of a small minority of Americans who owns the wealth of the US and exerts economic, military and political power in the US.  The book begins with the documentation of the exploitation of First Nations, Black Americans and poor White Americans by a small power elite, founded by the landed gentry of Virginia and the merchant class of Massachusetts, Philadelphia and New York. It explains the root cause of racism in the US and the deeply ingrained desire for war mongering in the American psyche. It explains why the positino of commander-in-chief has greater importance to American voters than the position of president and why the primary qualifications for the job of president is successful war mongering. The author takes its readers through the complicit aid of England and France in enabling the US to dominate the continent and how failure of European cooperation and two disatrous World Wars in the twentieth century enabled the US to dominate the world. The author also explains how and why the US media supports thedomestic and world wide propaganda which conditions people, especially Americans, to believe the lies of American governments and reject all objective criticisms of US war mongering, commission war crimes around the world, overthrowing of democratically elected governments, installation of ruthless dictators, the spreading of global terrorism and the arming and military training of terrorists. The widely held naivety that the US believes in freedom of the press, free speech and peaceful expression of dissent, makes it difficult, if not impossible to convince people of the ruthless methods used by the US and its military might to crush worldwide democratic dissent.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,,4.25,4,0,"The Rise And Fall Of The American Empire: A Re Interpretation Of History, Economics And Philosophy: 1492 2006",,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348062966l/1565250.jpg,,,,,,,,,,

Virtually indestructible even into his golden years, he made electrifying headlines more than once: after a ship he was helming crashed into the soaring West Seattle Bridge, causing millions in damages; and following his inexplicable disappearance at age 80. Was he a suicide, a man broken by one costly misstep? Had he run off with a lifelong love? Or did a trail of gruesome evidence lead to the home Rolf shared with his wife, Ruth? On an island where everyone thought they knew their neighbors, the veneer of the Neslunds' marriage masked a convoluted case that took many years to solve. And, indeed, some still believe that the old sea captain will come home one day. ""The Sea Captain"" is a classic tale as blood chilling as murder itself.

1302,Barbara Kingsolver|Steven L. Hopp|Camille Kingsolver|Richard A. Houser,"Bestselling author Barbara Kingsolver returns with her first nonfiction narrative that will open your eyes in a hundred new ways to an old truth: You are what you eat. ""As the U.S. population made an unprecedented mad dash for the Sun Belt, one carload of us paddled against the tide, heading for the Promised Land where water falls from the sky and green stuff grows all around. We were about to begin the adventure of realigning our lives with our food chain. ""Naturally, our first stop was to buy junk food and fossil fuel..."" Hang on for the ride: With characteristic poetry and pluck, Barbara Kingsolver and her family sweep readers along on their journey away from the industrial-food pipeline to a rural life in which they vow to buy only food raised in their own neighborhood, grow it themselves, or learn to live without it. Their good-humored search yields surprising discoveries about turkey sex life and overly zealous zucchini plants, en route to a food culture that's better for the neighborhood and also better on the table. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, Animal, Vegetable, Miracle makes a passionate case for putting the kitchen back at the center of family life and diversified farms at the center of the American diet. ""This is the story of a year in which we made every attempt to feed ourselves animals and vegetables whose provenance we really knew . . . and of how our family was changed by our first year of deliberately eating food produced from the same place where we worked, went to school, loved our neighbors, drank the water, and breathed the air.""",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,370,4.04,91282,10427,"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life",Nonfiction|Food and Drink|Food|Autobiography|Memoir|Environment|Nature|Food and Drink|Cookbooks,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1480104279l/25460.jpg,370,,,,,,,,,
8733,Edith Wharton|Linda Wagner-Martin,"Considered by many to be her masterpiece, Edith Wharton's second full-length work is a scathing yet personal examination of the exploits and follies of the modern upper class. As she unfolds the story of Undine Spragg, from New York to Europe, Wharton affords us a detailed glimpse of what might be called the interior décor of this America and its nouveau riche fringes. Through a heroine who is as vain, spoiled, and selfish as she is irresistibly fascinating, and through a most intricate and satisfying plot that follows Undine's marriages and affairs, she conveys a vision of social behavior that is both supremely informed and supremely disenchanted. - Anita Brookner",,Paperback,9.78E+12,370,4.02,8468,796,The Custom of the Country,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literature|Literature|American|Literature|20th Century|Novels|Classics|Classic Literature|New York|Literary Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386922530l/26950.jpg,370,,,,,,,,,

A very literate, observant, insightful storyteller.""—The Bloomsbury Review""Reading this book was the next best thing to wandering in the woods with Peter Cashwell hoping to add a rufous-capped warbler to my life list. No, it was better—I could laugh out loud in delight as I turned the   without fear of scaring the birds.""—Katharine Weber, author of The Music Lesson""An entertaining and witty meditation on birding.""—Library JournalAll around the world, birds are the subject of intense, even spiritual, fascination, but relatively few people see the word bird as a verb. Peter Cashwell is one who does, and with good reason: He birds (because he can't help it), and he teaches grammar (because he's paid to). An English teacher by profession and an avid birder by inner calling, Cashwell has written a whimsical and critical book about his many obsessions—birds, birders, language, literature, parenting, pop culture, and the human race.Cashwell lovingly but irreverently explores the practice of birding, from choosing a field guide to luring vultures out of shrubbery, and gives his own eclectic travelogue of some of the nation's finest bird habitats. Part memoir, part natural history, part apology, The Verb 'To Bird' will enlighten and entertain anyone who's ever wandered around wet fields at the crack of dawn with dog-eared field guides crushed against the granola bars in their pockets. But you don't have to know the field marks of an indigo bunting to appreciate Cashwell's experiences with non-lending libraries, venomous insects, sports marketing, and animated Christmas specials.""Birders as well as all others interested in birds will enjoy this witty and informative meditation. Declaring himself a victim of birding compulsive disorder, Cashwell, an English teacher in Virginia, does an excellent job of describing his fascination with observing and listening to birds.""—Publishers Weekly""Peter Cashwell possesses one of the rarest of all qualities in a nature writer: an intelligent wit.""—Robert Finch, co-editor of The Norton Book of Nature Writing""A fine literary ramble and a good laugh to boot—no mean feat in a genre that perhaps takes itself to seriously.""—John Hanson Mitchell, Editor of Sanctuary, Journal of the Massachusetts Audubon Society""Writing with humor and gentle environmental rants, Cashwell does for his beloved birds what Bill Bryson did for the Appalachian Trail in his best-selling A Walk in the Woods.""—Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star""[Cashwell] does not stint on the details that matter to birders, but it's his ability to translate the joy of the experience for the non-birder that extends the book's appeal beyond the Nature/Ornithology shelves.""—The Charlotte Observer""Cashwell plays with the language as joyfully and skillfully as a musician coaxes melodies from his instrument.""—Rocky Mount TelegramBirds first captured Peter Cashwell's attention when his mother hung an avian mobile over his crib. He was born in Raleigh, N.C., grew up in Chapel Hill, and graduated from the University of North Carolina, where he took every creative writing course permitted by the English department (and one that wasn't).

43307,Janna Levin,"In this remarkable work of fiction, astrophysicist Janna Levin reimagines the lives of two of the most important and influential minds of our time.The narrator is a scientist herself, a physicist obsessed with Kurt Gödel, the greatest logician of many centuries, and with Alan Turing, the extraordinary mathematician, breaker of the Enigma Code during World War II. “They are both brilliantly original and outsiders,” the narrator tells us. “They are both besotted with mathematics. But for all their devotion, mathematics is indifferent, unaltered by any of their dramas . . . Against indifference, I want to tell their stories.” Which she does in a haunting, incantatory voice, the two lives unfolding in parallel narratives that overlap in the magnitude of each man’s achievement and demise: Gödel, delusional and paranoid, would starve himself to death; Turing, arrested for homosexual activities, would be driven to suicide. And they meet as well in the narrator’s mind, where facts are interwoven with her desire and determination to find meaning in the maze of their stories: two men devoted to truth of the highest abstract nature, yet unable to grasp the mundane truths of their own lives.A unique amalgam of luminous imagination and richly evoked historic character and event—A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines is a story about the pursuit of truth and its effect on the lives of two men.

9340,Idries Shah|LeCain,"Today we find him in a high-level physics report, illustrating phenomena that can't be described in ordinary technical terms. He appears in psychology textbooks, illuminating the workings of the mind in a way no straightforward explanation can. In three definitive volumes (The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin, The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin and The Subtleties of the Inimitable Mulla Nasrudin) Idries Shah takes us to the very heart of this mysterious mentor, the Mulla Nasrudin. Skillful contemporary retellings of hundreds of collected stories and sayings bring the unmistakable--often backhanded--wisdom, wit and charm of the timeless jokester to life. The Mulla and his stories appear in literature and oral traditions from the Middle East to Greece, Russia, France--even China. Many nations claim Nasrudin as a native son, but nobody really knows who he was or where he came from. According to a legend dating from at least the 13th century, Nasrudin was snatched as a schoolboy from the clutches of the ""Old Villain""--the crude system of thought that ensnares man--to carry through the ages the message of how to escape. He was chosen because he could make people laugh, and humor has a way of slipping through the cracks of the most rigid thinking habits. Acclaimed as humorous masterpieces, as collections of the finest jokes, as priceless gift books, and for hundreds ""enchanted tales,"" this folklore figure's antics have also been divined as ""mirroring the antics of the mind."" The jokes are, as Idries Shah notes, ""perfectly designed models for isolating and holding distortions of the mind which so often pass for reasonable behavior."" Therefore they have a double use: when the jokes have been enjoyed, their psychological significance starts to sink in. In fact, for many centuries they have been studied in Sufi circles for their hidden wisdom. They are used as teaching exercises, in part to momentarily ""freeze"" situations in which states of mind can be recognized. The key to the philosophic significance of the Nasrudin jokes is given in Idries Shah's book The Sufis and a complete system of mystical training based upon them was described in the Hibbert Journal. In these delightful volumes, Shah not only gives the Mulla a proper vehicle for our times, he proves that the centuries-old stories and quips of Nasrudin are still some of the funniest jokes in the world.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,224,4.38,416,35,The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin,Religion|Philosophy|Humor|Fiction|Spirituality|Religion|Islam,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348021570l/530425.jpg,224,,,,,,,,,

Why does recalling the 10 Commandments reduce our tendency to lie, even when we couldn't possibly be caught? Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save 25 cents on a can of soup? Why do we go back for second helpings at the unlimited buffet, even when our stomachs are already full? And how did we ever start spending $4.15 on a cup of coffee when, just a few years ago, we used to pay less than a dollar?When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we're in control. We think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we? In a series of illuminating, often surprising experiments, MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same types of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable - making us predictably irrational.From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions.

It is about Buddhism in daily life; about learning in a wholly practical way, how to build a better and happier life for yourself, and for those whom your life touches, no matter what the circumstances. You don't have to conform to a specific lifestyle. You don't have to be especially knowledgeable or dedicated or indeed religious in any way.

He hasn't seen his mother, Faye, since she walked out when he was a child. But then one day there she is, all over the news, throwing rocks at a presidential candidate.

Determined to solve the puzzle--and finally have something to deliver to his publisher--Samuel decides to capitalize on his mother's new fame by writing a tell-all biography, a book that will savage her intimately, publicly. But first, he has to locate her; and second, to talk to her without bursting into tears. As Samuel begins to excavate her history, the story moves from the rural Midwest of the 1960s to New York City during the Great Recession and Occupy Wall Street to the infamous riots at the 1968 Chicago Democratic National Convention, and finally to Norway, home of the mysterious Nix that his mother told him about as a child.

42537,Cornelius Ryan,"The classic account of the final offensive against Hitler's Third Reich.The Battle for Berlin was the culminating struggle of World War II in the European theater, the last offensive against Hitler's Third Reich, which devastated one of Europe's historic capitals and marked the final defeat of Nazi Germany. It was also one of the war's bloodiest and most pivotal battles, whose outcome would shape international politics for decades to come.Cornelius Ryan's compelling account of this final battle is a story of brutal extremes, of stunning military triumph alongside the stark conditions that the civilians of Berlin experienced in the face of the Allied assault. As always, Ryan delves beneath the military and political forces that were dictating events to explore the more immediate imperatives of survival, where, as the author describes it, “to eat had become more important than to love, to burrow more dignified than to fight, to exist more militarily correct than to win.”It is the story of ordinary people, both soldiers and civilians, caught up in the despair, frustration, and terror of defeat.

Since childhood, the young men have been shaped by stories that their late father was a Traveler, one of a small band of prophets who have vastly influenced the course of history.

20317,Karl May,"The Spanish name Llano Estacado, meaning Staked Plain, is part of the high plains of the United States, located west of today’s Lubbock, Texas. It covers an area of about 30,000 square miles, extending to the state of New Mexico. It is a strikingly flat and monotonous area at an elevation of between 3,000-4,000 feet. Local water-retaining depressions and washes that, due to the meager rainfall, rarely hold water occasionally break this semiarid plain. Sandstorms can cut down vision in the midst of day and scour the unwary with tiny bullets of sand. It is said that even Indians hesitated to cross this wasteland. Myth holds that the Coronado expedition planted stakes as guideposts for the return trip when it first crossed the plain westward, giving the area its name. Karl May has used the myth of the stakes as a backdrop for his story of ‘The Ghost of Llano Estacado’. Again, he assembles many of his Western heroes for new adventures and the performance of good deeds, in the process adding a few new characters. One of his recurring characters, Hobble-Frank, owner of the Villa “Bear Fat” in Saxony, know-it-all, mangler of half-knowledge, with his persistent and extensive elaboration’s, may have been funny a hundred years ago when read in German. However, his argumentative discourses, when translated into English, become rather tedious. They often have no meaning for the English-only reader, since they deal with local events and characters of his (and Karl May’s) home state, and mangle geography and ancient history in an attempt to be funny. At worst, they make no sense when translated. Hence, I have taken the liberty to severely edit his profuseness to make the story line flow more smoothly. Rest assured, that I have otherwise stayed as close as possible to Karl May’s writings and left even his many, many compass directions unaltered.",,Paperback,,,3.95,491,6,Pengembaraan Dr. Karl May: Llano Estacado,Adventure|Westerns|Fiction|Asian Literature|Indonesian Literature|Young Adult|Literature|19th Century|Childrens,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1191174075l/1974532.jpg,,,,,,,,,,

Ronald Reagan is in the White House, Molly Ringwald is on the cover of Time and 29-year-old Michael Gregoretti is a struggling, underpaid copywriter at a big New York ad agency. He'd rather be writing plays; instead, he's writing awful commercials for a moisturizer formulated to conquer that dire, life-threatening condition: handruff.Michael reluctantly accepts an assignment on a brand-new (and very secret) product – an aerosol butter – hoping it will lead to the kind of work that will land him a better job at another agency. But there's a catch: Working on this new account will also mean working for the rigid, compulsive and quite possibly insane Gwen Hammond, who thinks that Michael, with his off-the-wall ideas and unconventional campaigns, is just too much of a rebel to work with such a conservative client.To further complicate life, Michael meets and falls for Craig Connolly, an absolute dreamboat from the South with a voice like FM radio and a face to match. Craig claims he'd like to be in a relationship and Michael wants to believe it. The problem is, Craig is already married – to his job.Michael survives it all with the help of his two best friends: Irene Lucca, a witty book editor with a flair for vintage clothing and an eye for the art director Michael works with, and Anthony DeLorenzo, Michael's wise (and wisecracking) roommate and staunchest supporter.By the time A Fool Among Fools ends, Michael has battled stuffy clients and stifling supervisors, written and produced what just might be the worst commercials in the history of advertising, found and lost love, and managed to keep himself – and the reader – laughing along the way.",,ebook,,375,3.91,23,16,A Fool Among Fools,Fiction|Gay|Gay Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372859249l/18159376.jpg,375,,,,,,,,,

43482,Roger Rheinheimer|Crystal Linn,"Ava Troyer never really considered the possibility of life outside of the warm, protective Amish community. Even during her state-mandated schooling through the eighth grade, she would dreamily fantasize about whether any of the other Amish boys in the history class right after lunch was going to be the father of her children, or if she would meet the man of her dreams from another state, an exciting possibility. But the wreck that killed her father and almost killed Ava, that early Sunday morning, at the hands of an all-night reveler, changed everything. The young man in military fatigues that pulled her to safety spoke Pennsylvania Dutch to her, but he wasn’t Amish. Or was he? And how could she be so powerfully attracted to a young man about to go overseas to war, something she fiercely believed was wrong? Roger Rheinheimer spent the first eighteen years of his life in northern Indiana. His father was the only doctor for a small town of 1200, and had a hitching rail on a side street by his office for the Amish patients. His father bought an eighty acre farm, and Roger and his older brother worked it, raising cattle and growing crops. While he was still in high school, Roger learned woodworking skills from Elmer Schlabach, his Amish mentor. They built houses in the old-fashioned tradition, from hand-mixing the concrete for the foundations to hand-nailing the shingles. The only phase they did not do was the electrical. To this day, Roger enjoys using his wood crafting skills, making acoustic guitars and furniture. Roger earned an undergraduate degree in Behavioral Psychology from a small private college in the Shenandoah Valley, took a Creative Writing class, loved it, and published a short story called My Brother. He was a regular contributing writer to the college newspaper. Roger has two novels in print and ebook, Amish Snow and Yield Spread: a novel. Crystal Linn : I am an award-winning poet who has written all of my life. I have been blessed with the ability to write in several styles and formats. It is great fun co-authoring the Amish novels with Roger Rheinheimer. I look forward to writing more books with Roger, and to begin writing parenting books from my view point as a professional working with children and the adults in their lives. My home is in the Pacific Northwest with my husband and dog, Rosa. My hobbies include reading mysteries, writing, and sailing with family and friends.

His article about Martha Walter, an American Impressionist painter (1875-1976), was published in the American Art Review in May 1978 Mr. David's new book, Bader Field, embodies the emotional story of a son's loving relationship with his father a legendary art dealer whose life is suddenly taken by a massive coronary at the young age of fifty-eight years. His death plunges the twenty-four-year-old man onto the front lines of the family art business, which he had entered a mere three years prior. Battling with his own grief while trying to help his adoring but fragile mother survive, David forges forward with all of the elemental tools his father imparted to him. His journey proves a difficult one, not having yet recovered from the horrific loss of his brother to suicide just eight years earlier when he was found dead on the fourth floor of the Rittenhouse Square townhouse, which was home to the prestigious David David Gallery. His self-imposed obligation is to successfully take the family art business to the next generation and to give his own children every bit of love, kindness, and wisdom bestowed upon him by the unique man whom they will never know other than the mark he left on everyone who knew him. Bader Field adds significant insight into the mysterious workings and dealings of the art world. David speaks from experience of having been immersed in it all of his life and having lived it from the inside out.

With little sophistication, its two asphalt runways juggled single and twin engine aircraft exuded a character and charm that created memories to last a lifetime.

6636,Katherine Boo,"From Pulitzer Prize-winner Katherine Boo, a landmark work of narrative nonfiction that tells the dramatic and sometimes heartbreaking story of families striving toward a better life in one of the twenty-first century's great, unequal cities.In this brilliantly written, fast-paced book, based on three years of uncompromising reporting, a bewildering age of global change and inequality is made human. Annawadi is a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport, and as India starts to prosper, Annawadians are electric with hope. Abdul, a reflective and enterprising Muslim teenager, sees ""a fortune beyond counting"" in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Asha, a woman of formidable wit and deep scars from a childhood in rural poverty, has identified an alternate route to the middle class: political corruption. With a little luck, her sensitive, beautiful daughter - Annawadi's ""most-everything girl"" - will soon become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest Annawadians, like Kalu, a fifteen-year-old scrap-metal thief, believe themselves inching closer to the good lives and good times they call ""the full enjoy."" But then Abdul the garbage sorter is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and a global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power and economic envy turn brutal. As the tenderest individual hopes intersect with the greatest global truths, the true contours of a competitive age are revealed. And so, too, are the imaginations and courage of the people of Annawadi. With intelligence, humor, and deep insight into what connects human beings to one another in an era of tumultuous change, Behind the Beautiful Forevers carries the reader headlong into one of the twenty-first century's hidden worlds, and into the lives of people impossible to forget.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,256,3.97,86195,9929,"Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity",Nonfiction|Cultural|India|History|Cultural|Asia|Social Issues|Poverty|Book Club|Audiobook|Travel|Sociology|Abandoned,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1315601232l/11869272.jpg,256,,,,,,,,,

This network of tales is told by a near-sighted child, half-British, half-European, certain she can make peace in her family and within the culture. Neither her culture nor her family is ready for peace. This haunting novel spans wars, continents, and the Great Depression. It spins a strange future from old loves, loyalties, and secrets. A free-spirited bride shapes herself into convention. A grandparent's death reaches across time and continents. An officer faces civilian life. A mother betrays her daughter. Reality is more dangerous than imagination; religion, than sex. Reserve shrouds fact and prejudice. A sweater, glasses, letter, shard: each changes the course of a life. A girls’ school breeds strictures, loves, betrayals. A religious meeting forces impossible choices. A mother’s secret, long held, ordains a daughter’s life. A grasshopper, moth, puppy: each can end a childhood and unfold truths and passions, rarely simple. Throughout, the great heart of Australia beats in each life and decision. And a young girl’s widening world reminds us that we each grow because of—and in spite of—family and culture.

The first of these stories traces Okonkwo's fall from grace with the tribal world in which he lives, and in its classical purity of line and economical beauty it provides us with a powerful fable about the immemorial conflict between the individual and society. The second story, which is as modern as the first is ancient, and which elevates the book to a tragic plane, concerns the clash of cultures and the destruction of Okonkwo's world through the arrival of aggressive, proselytizing European missionaries. These twin dramas are perfectly harmonized, and they are modulated by an awareness capable of encompassing at once the life of nature, human history, and the mysterious compulsions of the soul.

51670,Roberto Bolaño|Angelo Morino,"«Ho scritto questo libro per me stesso, e neppure di questo sono troppo sicuro. Per molto tempo sono state solo pagine sparse che rileggevo e forse correggevo convinto di non avere tempo. Ma tempo per cosa? Ero incapace di spiegarlo con precisione. Ho scritto questo libro per i fantasmi, che sono gli unici ad avere tempo perché sono fuori dal tempo». Anversa è il primo romanzo scritto da Bolaño («Naturalmente, non ho mai portato questo romanzo a una casa editrice») ed è anche l'ultimo pubblicato in vita. L'inizio e la fine, a distanza di vent'anni, di una storia di scrittore indipendente dalla cosiddetta letteratura ufficiale, diventato un riconosciuto innovatore, un autore di riferimento e un maestro, grazie alla chiarezza e la tristezza di un modo di scrivere il cui rischio principale è quello si usare la letteratura per cercare di ripetere un'esperienza del mondo, di fermare i vissuti propri e quindi, appunto perché irripetibili e mai del tutto decifrabili, aperti alla libertà di tutti di ammaliarsene e riviverli. E Anversa chiude, infatti, con una frase che è un impegno programmatico: «Come quei versi di Leopardi che Daniel Biga recitava su un ponte nordico per armarsi di coraggio, così sia la mia scrittura». Nello scheletro del romanzo, l'intreccio è un poliziesco: vi è un protagonista, da poco in Spagna, che lavora sulla Costa Brava, prima in un maneggio e poi in un camping dove ha luogo un delitto; e un ispettore di polizia e una ragazza con cui il poliziotto ha rapporti sessuali in cui giocano il ricatto e la perversione. Ma tutto è frantumato, ridotto in fotogrammi e visioni, incroci con altre trame e ricordi, con nuovi personaggi, su un piano visibilmente autobiografico. E tutti i temi che torneranno nei successivi romanzi di Bolaño, e soprattutto il suo maggiore, I detective selvaggi, sono presenti: l'anarchia, il girovagare per ricerche incongrue, il destino dei poeti, la tendenza figlia delle amate avanguardie e del surrealismo al bizzarro e al deforme quotidiano di corpi e situazioni.",La memoria #709,Paperback,9.79E+12,152,3.6,2344,288,Anversa,Fiction|Literature|Cultural|Latin American|Novella,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1332008524l/9671564.jpg,152,,,,,,,,,

30488,Charles Eisenstein,"Sacred Economics traces the history of money from ancient gift economies to modern capitalism, revealing how the money system has contributed to alienation, competition, and scarcity, destroyed community, and necessitated endless growth. Today, these trends have reached their extreme—but in the wake of their collapse, we may find great opportunity to transition to a more connected, ecological, and sustainable way of being.   This book is about how the money system will have to change—and is already changing—to embody this transition. A broadly integrated synthesis of theory, policy, and practice, Sacred Economics explores avant-garde concepts of the New Economics, including negative-interest currencies, local currencies, resource-based economics, gift economies, and the restoration of the commons. Author Charles Eisenstein also considers the personal dimensions of this transition, speaking to those concerned with ""right livelihood"" and how to live according to their ideals in a world seemingly ruled by money. Tapping into a rich lineage of conventional and unconventional economic thought, Sacred Economics presents a vision that is original yet commonsense, radical yet gentle, and increasingly relevant as the crises of our civilization deepen.Sacred Economics official website: http://sacred-economics.com/About the Imprint: EVOLVER EDITIONS promotes a new counterculture that recognizes humanity's visionary potential and takes tangible, pragmatic steps to realize it.

Our Review

Donna Jo Napoli, the acclaimed author of 

Zel

, 

Sirena

, and 

Stones in Water

, now delivers a version of Beauty and the Beast destined to be a classic. Beast is the story of Orasmyn, a young Persian prince who makes a single wrong decision that sets an ancient curse into motion and forever changes his fate. Transformed into a lion on the exact day his father is to embark on a lion hunt, Orasmyn escapes his beloved Persia and travels across Europe in search of redemption and forgiveness. Although Beauty and the Beast has been retold many times -- in the form of a story, a movie, a television show, and even a Broadway musical -- it is usually told from Beauty's perspective, leaving readers to wonder what the prince did that was so terrible he was transformed into a beast. Napoli's Beast chronicles who the Beast was before Beauty found him.Prince Orasmyn, born into a wealthy Muslim family during ancient times, helps a personal servant out of a difficult situation but in doing so violates the Qur'an and is transformed into a lion. Napoli, head of the linguistics department at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, weaves history, biology, foreign languages, and religion into the story of how he deals with this transformation.Beast is filled with entrancing passages about what it is like for Orasmyn to survive among the lions, deer, snakes, and other animals he encounters in the wild. The book steps into the life of this princely lion convincingly and includes beautifully written episodes about the nature of the hunt. Adapting to the life of a beast is not easy for Orasmyn: ""A cub runs between my legs. I trip and roll toward a lioness at one side. Astonishingly, she backs up with a growl. I get to my feet and run straight past her. The ruling male...runs after me.... He chases at a slow pace. Just to let me know that I don't belong, I'm not welcome. This is not my home. I am a lion, and I am not a lion.""A lion in body but not in mind, Orasmyn comes to realize that to break the curse, he must trek through Europe to find someone who will love him. He stumbles upon a castle in the deep woods of France, and the rest of the story is a familiar tale.Napoli excels in telling Beast for many reasons, including the way she entwines many topics taught in American high schools into the story line. While in the castle's library, for instance, the Beast begins reading the Aeneid, which is studied by many advanced Latin students. The author includes familiar Latin passages and their translations. Farsi (the native language of Persia) and Arabic words are also integrated into the story, and a glossary at the end of the book allows for a better understanding of their meanings.Middle Eastern religions, often given little attention in classrooms, are also incorporated into Beast, for Orasmyn was raised as a Muslim with Persian customs. The book shows how Islamic culture borrows many of its traditions from the Zoroastrians and how halal meat is prepared according to a sacred ritual, something also seen among Jews. The borrowing of traditions from the region's different religions, although not emphasized in the book, is particularly interesting to consider during a troublesome time in the Middle East today.At a glance, Beast is a typical fairy tale retold, but the depth and scope of this book are far-reaching. Napoli has written a story best suited for advanced teen readers and even adults. Bring it to your book group. Bring it to your teachers. Bring it to your friends. They will thank you for bringing Beast to their attention.--Soozan Baxter",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,260,3.45,6409,458,Beast,Fantasy|Young Adult|Fantasy|Fairy Tales|Romance|Fairy Tales|Beauty and The Beast|Retellings|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1181706403l/1182813.jpg,260,,,,,,,,,

Beginning with the study of DNA in Egyptian mummies in the early 1980s and culminating in the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010, Neanderthal Man describes the events, intrigues, failures, and triumphs of these scientifically rich years through the lens of the pioneer and inventor of the field of ancient DNA.We learn that Neanderthal genes offer a unique window into the lives of our hominin relatives and may hold the key to unlocking the mystery of why humans survived while Neanderthals went extinct. Drawing on genetic and fossil clues, Pääbo explores what is known about the origin of modern humans and their relationship to the Neanderthals and describes the fierce debate surrounding the nature of the two species’ interactions. His findings have not only redrawn our family tree, but recast the fundamentals of human history—the biological beginnings of fully modern Homo sapiens, the direct ancestors of all people alive today.A riveting story about a visionary researcher and the nature of scientific inquiry, Neanderthal Man offers rich insight into the fundamental question of who we are.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,288,4.03,1654,195,Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes,Nonfiction|Science|History|Anthropology|Biology|Evolution|Science|Biology|Biology|Genetics,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386384555l/19243883.jpg,288,,,,,,,,,

But perhaps they are no longer alone in this opinion. Newly allied with the powerful African empire of the Tswana, the French have occupied Spain and brought revolution and bloodshed to Brazil, threatening Britain’s last desperate hope to defeat Napoleon.   And now the government that sidelined them has decided they have the best chance at negotiating a peace with the angry Tswana, who have besieged the Portuguese royal family in Rio—and thus offer to reinstate Laurence to his former rank and seniority as a captain in the Aerial Corps. Temeraire is delighted by this sudden reversal of fortune, but Laurence is by no means sanguine, knowing from experience that personal honor and duty to one’s country do not always run on parallel tracks.   Nonetheless, the pair embark for Brazil, only to meet with a string of unmitigated disasters that force them to make an unexpected landing in the hostile territory of the Incan empire, where they face new unanticipated dangers.   Now with the success of the mission balanced on a razor’s edge, and failure looking more likely by the minute, the unexpected arrival of an old enemy will tip the scales toward ruin. Yet even in the midst of disaster, opportunity may lurk—for one bold enough to grasp it.",Del Rey,Hardcover,9.78E+12,325,3.93,9887,723,Crucible of Gold,Fantasy|Fantasy|Dragons|Historical|Historical Fiction|Science Fiction|Alternate History|Fiction|Historical,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333577662l/12069434.jpg,325,,,,,,,,,

19764,John Rawls,"John Rawls's work on justice has drawn more commentary and aroused wider attention than any other work in moral or political philosophy in the twentieth century. Rawls is the author of two major treatises, A Theory of Justice (1971) and Political Liberalism (1993); it is said that A Theory of Justice revived political philosophy in the English-speaking world. But before and after writing his great treatises Rawls produced a steady stream of essays. Some of these essays articulate views of justice and liberalism distinct from those found in the two books. They are important in and of themselves because of the deep issues about the nature of justice, moral reasoning, and liberalism they raise as well as for the light they shed on the evolution of Rawls's views. Some of the articles tackle issues not addressed in either book. They help identify some of the paths open to liberal theorists of justice and some of the knotty problems which liberal theorists must seek to resolve.

What they have in common is a hunch about human psychology: that it's our constant effort to eliminate the negative that causes us to feel so anxious, insecure, and unhappy. And that there is an alternative ""negative path"" to happiness and success that involves embracing the things we spend our lives trying to avoid. It is a subversive, galvanizing message, which turns out to have a long and distinguished philosophical lineage ranging from ancient Roman Stoic philosophers to Buddhists. Oliver Burkeman talks to life coaches paid to make their clients' lives a living hell, and to maverick security experts such as Bruce Schneier, who contends that the changes we've made to airport and aircraft security since the 9/11 attacks have actually made us less safe. And then there are the ""backwards"" business gurus, who suggest not having any goals at all and not planning for a company's future.

The history of the family dates from 1861, the year of the publication of Bachofen�s �Mutterrecht� (maternal law) Engles makes the following propositions: 1. That in the beginning people lived in unrestricted sexual intercourse, which he dubs, not very felicitously, hetaerism. 2. That such an intercourse excludes any absolutely certain means of determining parentage; that consequently descent could only be traced by the female line in compliance with maternal law � and that this was universally practiced by all the nations of antiquity. 3. That consequently women as mothers, being the only well known parents of younger generations, received a high tribute of respect and deference, amounting to a complete women�s rule (gynaicocracy), according to Bachofen�s idea. 4. That the transition to monogamy, reserving a certain woman exclusively to one man, implied the violation of the primeval religious law (i.e., practically a violation of the customary right of all other men to the same woman), which violation had to be atoned for its permission purchased by the surrender of the women to the public for a limited time.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,220,4.09,2680,152,"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State",Philosophy|Politics|History|Nonfiction|Sociology|Economics|Feminism,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390348331l/52198.jpg,220,,,,,,,,,

Lovecraft had no idea that he would come to be regarded as the godfather of the modern horror genre, nor that his work would influence an entire generation of writers, including Stephen King and Anne Rice. Now, at last, the most important tales of this distinctive American genious are gathered in one volume by National Book Award-winning author Joyce Carol Oates.Combining the nineteenth-century gothic sesibility of Edgar Allan Poe with a daring internal vision, Lovecraft's tales foretold a psychically troubled century to come.  Set in a meticulously described, historically grounded New England landscape, his harrowing stories explore the collapse of sanity beneath the weight of chaotic events.  Lovecraft's universe is a frightening shadow world where reality and nightmare intertwine, and redemption can come only from below.  In her preceptive and penetrating introduction, Oates, herself a virtuoso of the Gothic style, explains how Lovecraft's singular talents fused the supernatural and mundane into a terrifying complex, exquisitely realized vision.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,352,4.2,5384,187,Tales of H.P.

47880,Gabor Maté,"He would probably dispute it, but Gabor Maté is something of a compassion machine. Diligently treating the drug addicts of Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside with sympathy in his heart and legislative reform in mind can't be easy. But Maté never judges. His book is a powerful call-to-arms, both for the decriminalization of drugs and for a more sympathetic and informed view of addiction. As Maté observes, ""Those whom we dismiss as 'junkies' are not creatures from a different world, only men and women mired at the extreme end of a continuum on which, here or there, all of us might well locate ourselves."" In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts begins by introducing us to many of Dr. Maté's most dire patients who steal, cheat, sell sex, and otherwise harm themselves for their next hit. Maté looks to the root causes of addiction, applying a clinical and psychological view to the physical manifestation and offering some enlightening answers for why people inflict such catastrophe on themselves.Finally, he takes aim at the hugely ineffectual, largely U.S.-led War on Drugs (and its worldwide followers), challenging the wisdom of fighting drugs instead of aiding the addicts, and showing how controversial measures such as safe injection sites are measurably more successful at reducing drug-related crime and the spread of disease than anything most major governments have going. It's not easy reading, but we ignore his arguments at our peril. When it comes to combating the drug trade and the ravages of addiction, society can use all the help it can get. --Kim Hughes",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,480,4.46,4880,545,In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction,Nonfiction|Psychology|Health|Science|Health|Mental Health,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327970900l/617702.jpg,480,,,,,,,,,

Not so much a stream of consciousness, as an unconscious railing against a life that makes little sense, and a shocking and intimate insight into the thoughts, feelings and chaotic sexuality of a vulnerable and isolated protagonist. To read A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing is to plunge inside its narrator's head, experiencing her world first-hand. This isn't always comfortable - but it is always a revelation.Touching on everything from family violence to sexuality and the personal struggle to remain intact in times of intense trauma, McBride writes with singular intensity, acute sensitivity and mordant wit.

În plus, chiar fragmentele preluate, de regulă fără mari modificări, au fost supuse totuşi unei «autocenzuri». Sunt eliminate sau atenuate tocmai impresiile – şi uneori izbucnirile – cele mai sincere ale reginei, care, evident, nu pu-teau fi făcute publice: cuvinte adesea grele la adresa regelui Ferdinand, a prinţului moştenitor Carol, a prim-ministrului Ionel Brătianu sau a clasei poli-tice româneşti în genere. Nu e nevoie de mai multe argumente pentru a justifica publicarea integrală a Jurnalului; odată ce dispunem de textul originar complet, n-avem nici un motiv să ne mulţumim cu versiunea trunchiată şi edulcorată a volumului memorialistic.

Este şi ziua când regina Maria începe să-şi ţină jurnalul, pe deplin conştientă că trăieşte un moment de maximă semnificaţie, atât pentru ţară, cât şi pentru propriul său destin. Titlul Jurnal de război ne aparţine şi necesită, poate, o precizare. Uniforma albă de infirmieră în care a apărut în toţi aceşti ani ar putea lăsa impresia unui efort, desigur demn de elogii, dar de ordin aproape exclusiv «sanitar» şi umanitar. În fapt, regina intervine în toate resorturile războiului. Chiar dacă nu avea nici o calitate oficială în dirijarea treburilor publice (nu era regină domnitoare, ci doar soţie de rege), a jucat un rol deloc neglijabil în orientarea generală a României în preajma şi în timpul războiului. Într-un anume sens, a fost războiul ei.Volumul prim al Jurnalului de război se încheie în preajma marilor bătălii din vara anului 1917. Vor urma încă două volume.

But when his widowed grandfather passes away suddenly, the patriarch’s last will and testament makes a substantial demand of Jacob and his estranged relatives: in order to claim their inheritances, everyone named in the will must work together long enough to clear out the home of the old man and his late wife. ANDY TAMBLYN would love to know more about the family history that her husband, Jacob, refuses to divulge. Seeing the scenario as her big chance to glean better insight into her darling spouse, Andy joins him in the task—despite sentencing herself to the condemnation of her acerbic mother-in-law, Ruth.

23994,Danah Zohar,"At the beginning of the twentieth century psychologists discovered ways and means to measure intelligence that developed into an obsession with IQ. In the mid 1990's, Daniel Goleman popularised research into emotional intelligence, EQ, pointing out that EQ is a basic requirement for the appropriate use of IQ. In this century, there is enough collective evidence from psychology, neurology, anthropology and cognitive science to show us that there is a third 'Q', 'SQ' or Spiritual Intelligence. SQ is uniquely human and, the authors argue, the most fundamental intelligence. SQ is what we use to develop our longing and capacity for meaning, vision and value. It allows us to dream and to strive. It underlies the things we believe in, and the role our beliefs and values play in the actions that we take and the way we shape our lives.",,ebook,9.78E+12,336,4,22,1,Spiritual Intelligence: The Ultimate Intelligence,Psychology|Spirituality|Religion|Social Science,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1370839124l/16559545.jpg,336,,,,,,,,,

9363,John Elder Robison,"Ever since he was small, John Robison had longed to connect with other people, but by the time he was a teenager, his odd habits—an inclination to blurt out non sequiturs, avoid eye contact, dismantle radios, and dig five-foot holes (and stick his younger brother in them)—had earned him the label “social deviant.” No guidance came from his mother, who conversed with light fixtures, or his father, who spent evenings pickling himself in sherry. It was no wonder he gravitated to machines, which could, at least, be counted on.After fleeing his parents and dropping out of high school, his savant-like ability to visualize electronic circuits landed him a gig with KISS, for whom he created their legendary fire-breathing guitars. Later, he drifted into a “real” job, as an engineer for a major toy company. But the higher Robison rose in the company, the more he had to pretend to be “normal” and do what he simply couldn’t: communicate. It wasn’t worth the paycheck.It was not until he was forty that an insightful therapist told him he had the form of autism called Asperger’s syndrome. That understanding transformed the way Robison saw himself—and the world.Look Me in the Eye is the moving, darkly funny story of growing up with Asperger’s at a time when the diagnosis simply didn’t exist. A born storyteller, Robison takes you inside the head of a boy whom teachers and other adults regarded as “defective,” who could not avail himself of KISS’s endless supply of groupies, and who still has a peculiar aversion to using people’s given names (he calls his wife “Unit Two”). He also provides a fascinating reverse angle on the younger brother he left at the mercy of their nutty parents—the boy who would later change his name to Augusten Burroughs and write the bestselling memoir Running with Scissors.Ultimately, this is the story of Robison’s journey from his world into ours, and his new life as a husband, father, and successful small business owner—repairing his beloved high-end automobiles. It’s a strange, sly, indelible account—sometimes alien, yet always deeply human.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,304,3.91,55199,3938,Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography|Psychology,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320509615l/454856.jpg,304,,,,,,,,,

The good news, according to Grossman - drawing on dozens of interviews, first-person reports, and historic studies of combat, ranging from Frederick the Great's battles in the eighteenth century through Vietnam - is that the vast majority of soldiers are loath to kill. In World War II, for instance, only 15 to 25 percent of combat infantry were willing to fire their rifles. The provocative news is that modern armies, using Pavlovian and operant conditioning, have learned how to overcome this reluctance. In Korea about 50 percent of combat infantry were willing to shoot, and in Vietnam the figure rose to over 90 percent. The bad news is that by conditioning soldiers to overcome their instinctive loathing of killing, we have drastically increased post-combat stress - witness the devastated psychological state of our Vietnam vets as compared with those from earlier wars. And the truly terrible news is that contemporary civilian society, particularly the media, replicates the army's conditioning techniques and - according to Grossman's controversial thesis - is responsible for our rising rates of murder and violence, particularly among the young. In the explosive last section of the book, he argues that high-body-count movies, television violence (both news and entertainment), and interactive point-and-shoot video games are dangerously similar to thetraining programs that dehumanize the enemy, desensitize soldiers to the psychological ramifications of killing, and make pulling the trigger an automatic response.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,366,4.17,6430,609,On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,Nonfiction|Psychology|War|Military Fiction|War|History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1424794897l/818610.jpg,366,,,,,,,,,

33503,Ryan Gattis,"In 1991, a black man named Rodney King was severely beaten by multiple white police officers after a high-speed car chase that ended in a suburb of Los Angeles, an event that might have escaped the eyes of the American public had a witness not videotaped it from his balcony. The officers were taken to court, but eventually acquitted, and thus spawned the 1992 Los Angeles Riots: six days of looting, arson, assault, and murder that spread from South Central LA into the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and only stopped after soldiers from the National Guard were called in as backup for the overwhelmed and vilified LAPD.But on the streets of the South Central neighbourhood of Lynwood, the story played out differently than on the national news. In All Involved, Ryan Gattis weaves a narrative from the perspectives of people whose stories of the riots were never told--members of the gang underworld. Inspired by unprecedented access to the inner workings of these organizations, Gattis channels their experiences into a gritty, cinematic tale that is both shocking and devastating. Though the events of this book are fiction, every word is infused with authenticity and intimacy. Evoking the anger, the uncertainty, and the turmoil of those six days, Gattis turns Los Angeles from merely a setting to a living, breathing entity.With the velocity of a fast-paced thriller and the commanding talent of an incredibly adept writer, All Involved is an epic story of race, revenge, loyalty--at once fiercely identifiable as a novel of Los Angeles, yet also recognizable as a story of America--its history, its prejudices, and its complexities, laid bare.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,384,4.02,2785,393,All Involved,Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Mystery|Crime|Historical,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411334716l/22756871.jpg,384,,,,,,,,,

42983,William S. Burroughs|James Grauerholz,"In 1954 William Burroughs settled in Tangiers, finding a sanctuary of sorts in its shadowy streets, blind alleys, and lowlife decadence. It was this city that served as a catalyst for Burroughs as a writer, the backdrop for one of the most radical transformations of style in literary history.Burroughs's life during this period is limned in a startling collection of short stories, autobiographical sketches, letters, and diary entries, all of which showcase his trademark mordant humor, while delineating the addictions to drugs and sex that are the central metaphors of his work. But it is the extraordinary ""WORD,"" a long, sexually wild and deliberately offensive tirade, that blends confession, routine, and fantasy and marks the true turning point of Burroughs as a writer-the breakthrough of his own characteristic voice that will find its full realization in Naked Lunch. James Grauerholz's incisive introduction sets the scene for this series of pieces, guiding the reader through Burroughs's literary evolution from the precise, laconic, and deadpan writer of Junky and Queer to the radical, uncompromising seer of Naked Lunch.

Following an incident with an escaped tiger, Jaffy goes to work for Mr. Charles Jamrach, the famed importer of exotic animals, alongside Tim, a good but sometimes spitefully competitive boy. Thus begins a long, close friendship fraught with ambiguity and rivalry. Mr. Jamrach recruits the two boys to capture a fabled dragon during the course of a three-year whaling expedi­tion. Onboard, Jaffy and Tim enjoy the rough brotherhood of sailors and the brutal art of whale hunting. They even succeed in catching the reptilian beast. But when the ship’s whaling venture falls short of expecta­tions, the crew begins to regard the dragon—seething with feral power in its cage—as bad luck, a feeling that is cruelly reinforced when a violent storm sinks the ship. Drifting across an increasingly hallucinatory ocean, the sur­vivors, including Jaffy and Tim, are forced to confront their own place in the animal kingdom.

23660,David Benioff,"An absorbing novel of crime, its terrifying consequences, and a bond that redefines the friendship of three restless young men. Wall Street speculators, the Manhattan downtown club scene, Russian gangsters, immigrant neighborhoods - all the elements in the urban turf of this finely crafted contemporary crime novel wed danger with excitement and possibility. They're the rewards that Monty Brogan, who stands at the center of the moral glare in this tale, has already lost, just as he's lost his Corvette, and the ""sway"" that opened the doors of exclusive night spots and guaranteed him courtside seats at Madison Square Garden. Tomorrow Monty's traveling by bus, to the federal prison in Otisville, for seven years. He's afraid, and all he'd ever really wanted when he grew up was to be a fireman. With the pulse of the city in its prose, this debut novel follows Monty through the twenty-four hours of his last day out. At the same time, it illuminates the worlds, and souls, of his two best friends: Frank Slattery, an edgy bond trader who gambles daily with financial ruin, and Jakob Elinsky, an English teacher who clings to illusions as he compromises his ideals. Friends since their high school days, the three of them nostalgically share a past, but warily they confront a future that can no longer accommodate their adolescent dreams. They meet. They drink, and talk, go clubbing, dance, drink, and remember. What neither Slattery nor Jakob know, however, is that Monty has a plan. It's a shocker.Originally published: New York: Carroll & Graf Pub., 2000.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,224,3.81,4357,424,The 25th Hour,Fiction|Mystery|Crime|Mystery|New York,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1309201611l/379160.jpg,224,,,,,,,,,

Whether exploring significant public events or small private choices, Sandra Martz again captures word portraits that resonate with authenticity from the tapestry of their lives. This absorbing collection eloquently reflects women's choices, from a ten-year-old girl making a relationship decision to a grown woman who must choose whether or not to 'burden' her aging parents with the news that she is seriously ill, to a charmingly eccentric older woman who 'would not change one stitch... not one stitch' in the fabric of her life. Some speak of lost opportunities: 'I wait too long; I watch the moment pass/till only ashes stir upon the grass' or things they would do differently: 'If I could begin again... let me begin again by being a better daughter'. More often, however, these women proclaim a sense ofsatisfaction with their lives and 'would not change a single breathless moment'.This powerful and insightful collection features many talented contributors from Sandra Martz's best-selling When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple.

That writer was her son, Todd McCaffrey. Together, they penned a triumphant new chapter in the annals of the extraordinarily popular Dragonriders of Pern. Now, for the first time, Todd McCaffrey flies alone. And Dragonsblood is proof that the future of Pern is in good hands. After all, dragons are in his blood…Never in the dramatic history of Pern has there been a more dire emergency than that which faces the young dragonrider Lorana. A mysterious fatal illness is striking dragons. The epidemic is spreading like wildfire…and the next deadly cycle of Threadfall is only days away. Somehow, Lorana must find a cure before the dragons–including her own beloved Arith–succumb to the sickness, leaving Pern undefended.The lyrics of an all-but-forgotten song seem to point toward an answer from nearly five hundred years in the past, when Kitti Ping and her daughter Wind Blossom bred the first dragons from their smaller cousins, the fire-lizards. No doubt the first colonists possessed the advanced technology to find the cure for which Lorana seeks, but over the centuries, that knowledge has been lost.Or has it?For in the distant past, an aged Wind Blossom worries that the germs that affect the fire-lizards may one day turn on larger prey–and unleash a plague that will destroy the dragons, Pern’s only defenders against Thread. But as her people struggle to survive, Wind Blossom has neither the time nor the resources to expend on a future that may never arrive–until suddenly she uncovers evidence that her worst fears will come true.Now two brave women, separated by hundreds of years but joined by bonds transcending time, will become unknowing allies in a desperate race against sickness and Threadfall, with nothing less than the survival of all life on Pern at stake.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,438,4,7878,188,Dragonsblood,Fantasy|Science Fiction|Fantasy|Dragons,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1170597953l/61939.jpg,438,,,,,,,,,

11531,Juli Zeh,"Ada ist mit 12 Jahren auf erschreckende Weise erwachsen geworden. Vor zwei Jahren nämlich hat die hochintelligente Schülerin, neu am Bonner Ernst-Bloch-Gymnasium und im Unterricht gern in die Rolle der Lehrerin schlüpfend, beschlossen, alles als „gleich gültig“ anzusehen. Nur der Sport- und Deutschlehrer Smutek und Höfi, der Geschichtslehrer, können ihr Paroli bieten. Aber dann kommt der ebenso attraktive wie kluge Halbägypter Alev ins Spiel, dem alle „Prinzessinnen“ der Schule zu Füßen liegen. Ada und Alev scheinen wie geschaffen für ein Experiment jenseits moralischer Konventionen, bei dem es vor allem um die gleichberechtigten Startanlagen der Teilnehmer geht. Das intellektuelle Kräftemessen beginnt -- und weitet sich bald zu einer Obsession. Aber wer hält die Fäden in der Hand? Wie kann man Realität und Fiktion auseinanderhalten? Und: Gibt es eine Möglichkeit auszusteigen? Ada, so hieß schon einmal die (12-jährige) Heldin eines Buchs, in dem es um Spieltriebe in Internatsumgebung ging: um erotische Spiele, aber auch um solche mit Form und Inhalt. Ada oder Das Verlangen heißt dieses Buch, und der Meister adoleszenter Erotik, Vladmir Nabokov, hat es Ende der sechziger Jahre geschrieben. Ada erscheint darin als „anmutiger Computer“, dem der „Wortzirkus“ das größte Vergnügen bereitet. Und tatsächlich ist ADA ja auch der Name einer raffinierten, zur Strukturprüfung anderer Programme verwendeten Programmiersprache: unbewusst durchschauend und „intelligent dumm“ wie die Protagonistin von Zehs Spieltrieb eben. Auf beide Traditionen spielt Zehs Roman mehr als deutlich an: auch dies Teil einer intertextuellen Strategie, die das Buch um eine weitere Nuance bereichert. All diese Ebenen hat Zeh auf eine faszinierend konsequente, atmosphärisch überaus dichte Weise zu einer philosophischen Pubertätsgeschichte mit Liebes- und Krimielementen miteinander verwoben. Und sie hat dies so spielerisch leicht getan, das ihr faszinierender Roman auf hohem Niveau bestens, teils sogar vergnüglich lesbar geblieben ist. --Thomas Köster",,Paperback,9.78E+12,566,3.87,1520,84,Spieltrieb,Fiction|European Literature|German Literature|Contemporary,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364851532l/1975322.jpg,566,,,,,,,,,

The kind of guy who would never catch the attention of an insanely popular girl like Amanda Blake-or a psychic teenage government agent like Cass. But one day during lunch, Jake's whole life changed. He and Amanda suddenly locked eyes across the cafeteria, and at the exact same instant, they turned into zombies and devoured half their senior class.Now Jake definitely has Amanda's attention-as well as Cass's, since she's been sent on a top-secret mission to hunt them down. As Jake and Amanda deal with the existential guilt of eating their best friends, Cass struggles with a growing psychic dilemma of her own-one that will lead the three of them on an epic journey across the country and make them question what it means to truly be alive. Or undead.Eat, Brains, Love is a heartwarming and bloody blend of romance, deadpan humor, and suspense that fans of Isaac Marion's Warm Bodies will devour.

8038,Karl Wiggins,"Apart from breaking two of my mates' noses (one in the ring and one chasing a 'runner') I used to be known for my stories. And they were all true. I'd come back from distant shores and speak of my adventures. So much so in fact that people used to say, ""You should write a book."" My diatribes in my blogs and newspaper columns are simply my way of spinning the balls, because sometimes I like to see what number they land on. That’s all. But although I’m known mostly as a raconteur - and most of my books can be described as coming from the humourist vein – in ‘Nobody Asked Me’ I touch on some subjects that are surely going to upset a few people. I’ve never quite understood the politically correct brigade. Hardly any subject is taboo to the Englishman when he’s laughing. No longer simply a fad, blogging is now an important new literary innovation. This book is not a story, and if you’re looking for a book that is all sweetness and light, please give this one a miss. It’s not for you. I won’t be offended and I honestly wish you a great life. If everyone likes me, then I’m not being controversial enough – and trust me when I say that in this book I get controversial. Oh, don’t worry; the humour that my fans seem to enjoy so much is still there, but right now the planet’s spinning in new and scary directions, and this needs to be addressed. So inside the covers of this book I take a look at some of the challenges we’re currently facing. And some of my opinions are going to rattle a few people. So is a comedy writer honestly the best one to challenge some of the perceptions we’re facing nowadays? Well, I’ve always believed that if you can make people laugh then they tend to listen to what you say when you’re serious. And my goal, my life’s ambition if you like, is to give direction to comedy, purpose to satire. So why the rabbit popping out of a tin of soup on the cover. Well ‘Rabbit & Pork’ is Cockney rhyming slang for Talk, and on more than one occasion I’ve been accused of rabbiting away excessively – mostly at parties, and generally by my wife. But why a tin of soup? Well I tend to believe that everyone is born perfect. Nobody is born with an inherent capacity to hate. It has to be taught. All of our experiences – family, school, work, the books we read, the newspapers we peruse, the music we listen to, our friends, our social life, the opinions of those around us, religion, sports we play or watch, those we love and those who love us, those we desire and those who desire us, those we travel with, our hopes and dreams and ambitions and achievements, our triumphs and disasters - go into a metaphorical cooking pot that we carry with us throughout our lives. All these ‘ingredients’ make up our Soup of Life. Now, when making a soup, once you’ve added an ingredient, it’s forever blended in and you can’t take it out again. You add a sprinkling of finely chopped garnish; cumin or oregano, and you can never take that ingredient out again. Never, ever, ever. So say at the age of six you add black pepper or rosemary or hatred or love or comedy, from then onwards it’ll always be part and parcel of your ‘soup.’ And as you add more ingredients the ‘recipe’ of your life evolves, and before you know it you can’t taste the coriander or the love any more, but it’s still there at a deep subliminal level. Remember that. Some people may not add hatred until they’re in their twenties, and most of us never add it at all. And you can never entirely erase the flavour of a particular spice in soup.",,Kindle Edition,,474,4.32,38,4,"Nobody Asked Me, But ....",Politics|Nonfiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1459603588l/29760928.jpg,474,,,,,,,,,

After learning that one of his great aunt’s beloved and rare white bulldogs has been poisoned, the Orthodox bishop knows there is only one detective clever enough to investigate the murder: Sister Pelagia.The bespectacled, freckled Pelagia is lively, curious, extraordinarily clumsy, and persistent. At the estate in question, she finds a whole host of suspects, any one of whom might have benefited if the old lady (who changes her will at whim) had expired of grief at the pooch’s demise. There’s Pyotr, the matron’s grandson, a nihilist with a grudge who has fallen for the maid; Stepan, the penniless caretaker, who has sacrificed his youth to the care of the estate; Miss Wrigley, a mysterious Englishwoman who has recently been named sole heiress to the fortune; Poggio, an opportunistic and freeloading “artistic” photographer; and, most intriguingly, Naina, the old lady’s granddaughter, a girl so beautiful she could drive any man to do almost anything.As Pelagia bumbles and intuits her way to the heart of a mystery among people with faith only in greed and desire, she must bear in mind the words of Saint Paul: “Beware of dogs–and beware of evil-doers.”“Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have praised [Akunin’s] clever plots, vivid characters and wit.”–Baltimore Sun“Akunin’s wonderful novels are always intricately webbed and plotted.”–The Providence Journal",,Paperback,9.78E+12,273,3.72,1883,142,Sister Pelagia and the White Bulldog,Mystery|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Cultural|Russia|Mystery|Crime|Mystery|Historical Mystery,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386923912l/64550.jpg,273,,,,,,,,,

42089,Amulya Malladi,"From the acclaimed author of A Breath of Fresh Air, this beautiful novel takes us to modern India during the height of the summer’s mango season. Heat, passion, and controversy explode as a woman is forced to decide between romance and tradition.Every young Indian leaving the homeland for the United States is given the following orders by their parents: Don’t eat any cow (It’s still sacred!), don’t go out too much, save (and save, and save) your money, and most important, do not marry a foreigner. Priya Rao left India when she was twenty to study in the U.S., and she’s never been back. Now, seven years later, she’s out of excuses. She has to return and give her family the news: She’s engaged to Nick Collins, a kind, loving American man. It’s going to break their hearts.Returning to India is an overwhelming experience for Priya. When she was growing up, summer was all about mangoes—ripe, sweet mangoes, bursting with juices that dripped down your chin, hands, and neck. But after years away, she sweats as if she’s never been through an Indian summer before. Everything looks dirtier than she remembered. And things that used to seem natural (a buffalo strolling down a newly laid asphalt road, for example) now feel totally chaotic.But Priya’s relatives remain the same. Her mother and father insist that it’s time they arranged her marriage to a “nice Indian boy.” Her extended family talks of nothing but marriage—particularly the marriage of her uncle Anand, which still has them reeling. Not only did Anand marry a woman from another Indian state, but he also married for love. Happiness and love are not the point of her grandparents’ or her parents’ union. In her family’s rule book, duty is at the top of the list.Just as Priya begins to feel she can’t possibly tell her family that she’s engaged to an American, a secret is revealed that leaves her stunned and off-balance. Now she is forced to choose between the love of her family and Nick, the love of her life.As sharp and intoxicating as sugarcane juice bought fresh from a market cart, The Mango Season is a delightful trip into the heart and soul of both contemporary India and a woman on the edge of a profound life change.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,229,3.58,3515,366,The Mango Season,Fiction|Contemporary|Cultural|Asia|Cultural|Womens Fiction|Chick Lit,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320406877l/101384.jpg,229,,,,,,,,,

Patty was the ideal sort of neighbor, who could tell you where to recycle your batteries and how to get the local cops to actually do their job. She was an enviably perfect mother and the wife of Walter's dreams. Together with Walter-environmental lawyer, commuter cyclist, total family man-she was doing her small part to build a better world. But now, in the new millennium, the Berglunds have become a mystery. Why has their teenage son moved in with the aggressively Republican family next door? Why has Walter taken a job working with Big Coal? What exactly is Richard Katz-outré rocker and Walter's college best friend and rival-still doing in the picture? Most of all, what has happened to Patty? Why has the bright star of Barrier Street become ""a very different kind of neighbor,"" an implacable Fury coming unhinged before the street's attentive eyes?In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Freedom's intensely realized characters as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.",,Audio CD,9.78E+12,25,3.74,139156,13312,Freedom,Fiction|Contemporary|Novels|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1317063649l/7762715.jpg,25,,,,,,,,,

Let Their People Come provides six policy recommendations for unskilled immigration policy that seek to reconcile the irresistible force of migration with the immovable ideas in rich countries that keep this force in check.

53016,Apostolos K. Doxiadis|Christos H. Papadimitriou|Alecos Papadatos|Annie Di Donna,"An innovative, dramatic graphic novel about the treacherous pursuit of the foundations of mathematics.  This graphic novel recounts the spiritual odyssey of philosopher Bertrand Russell. In his agonized search for absolute truth, he crosses paths with thinkers like Gottlob Frege, David Hilbert & Kurt Gödel, & finds a passionate student in Ludwig Wittgenstein. But his most ambitious goal—to establish unshakable logical foundations of mathematics—continues to loom before him. Thru love & hate, peace & war, he persists in the mission threatening to claim both his career & happiness, finally driving him to the brink of insanity. This story is at the same time a historical novel & an accessible explication of some of the biggest ideas of mathematics & modern philosophy. With rich characterizations & atmospheric artwork, it spins the pursuit of such ideas into a satisfying tale. Probing, layered, the book throws light on Russell’s inner struggles while setting them in the context of the timeless questions he tried to answer. At its heart, Logicomix is a story about the conflict between ideal rationality & the flawed fabric of reality.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,352,4.02,13786,1346,Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth,Sequential Art|Graphic Novels|Sequential Art|Comics|Philosophy|Nonfiction|History|Biography|Science,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312031956l/6493321.jpg,352,,,,,,,,,

Sitting in his office on a warm spring day, he receives an unexpected visit from an Amish man who claims his brother, a dwarf like himself, has been murdered. Their discussion of the odd details of the case is interrupted by a commotion on campus, which turns out to be the apparent suicide of a young woman, who, it seems, has leapt to her death from the college bell tower.The investigations of these two deaths become intertwined as Professor Branden again teams up with his colleagues Pastor Cal Troyer and Sheriff Bruce Robertson to seek explanations for these bizarre events.Separate from the World is a story of a rift between two Amish factions, one that favors the use of medicine and that participates in a college study of genetic traits particular to the Amish community, and the other that rejects any outside influence.Once more, P.

Short-listed twice for the Booker Prize and the winner of a record four Miles Franklin Awards for Best Australian Novel, he has a gift for language virtually unrivaled among English-language novelists. His work is both tough and tender, primordial and new - always revealing the raw, instinctual drives that lure us together and rend us apart. In Eyrie, Winton crafts the story of Tom Keely, a man struggling to accomplish good in an utterly fallen world. Once an ambitious, altruistic environmentalist, Keely now finds himself broke, embroiled in scandal, and struggling to piece together some semblance of a life. From the heights of his urban high-rise apartment, he surveys the wreckage of his life and the world he's tumbled out of love with. Just before he descends completely into pills and sorrow, a woman from his past and her preternatural child appear, perched on the edge of disaster, desperate for help. When you're fighting to keep your head above water, how can you save someone else from drowning? As Keely slips into a nightmarish world of con artists, drug dealers, petty violence, and extortion, Winton confronts the cost of benevolence and creates a landscape of uncertainty.

51961,Anton Chekhov|Shelby Foote|Constance Garnett,"""        Chekhov is one of the few indispensable writers,"" said Susan Sontag. ""His stories, which deluge us with feeling, make feeling more intelligent; more magnanimous. He is an artist of our moral maturity.""        This volume presents forty-two of Chekhov's later short stories, written between 1888 and 1903, in acclaimed translations by Constance Garnett and chosen by Shelby Foote. Among the most outstanding are ""A Dreary Story,"" a dispassionate tale that reflects Chekhov's doubts about his role as an artist. Thomas Mann deemed it ""a truly extraordinary, fascinating story . . . unlike anything else in world literature."" ""The Darling,"" a delightful work highly admired by Tolstoy, offers comic proof that life has no meaning without love. And in ""The Lady with the Dog,"" which Vladimir Nabokov called ""one of the greatest stories ever written,"" a chance affair takes possession of a bored young woman and a cynical roué, changing their lives forever. Also included in this collection are the famous trilogy, ""The Man in a Case,"" ""Gooseberries,"" and ""About Love,"" as well as ""Sleepy,"" ""The Horse-Stealers,"" and ""Betrothed.""        ""The greatest of Chekhov's stories are, no matter how many times reread, always an experience that strikes deep into the soul and produces an alteration there,"" wrote William Maxwell.

Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group.Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents the science behind the secret and previously unknown life of trees and their communication abilities; he describes how these discoveries have informed his own practices in the forest around him. As he says, a happy forest is a healthy forest, and he believes that eco-friendly practices not only are economically sustainable but also benefit the health of our planet and the mental and physical health of all who live on Earth.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,288,4.06,15502,2355,"The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World",Nonfiction|Science|Environment|Nature|Environment|Science|Biology,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1464281905l/28256439.jpg,288,,,,,,,,,

40966,Willie Nelson,"The definitive autobiography of Willie Nelson ""Unvarnished. Funny. Leaving no stone unturned."" . . . So say the publishers about this book I've written. What I say is that this is the story of my life, told as clear as a Texas sky and in the same rhythm that I lived it. It's a story of restlessness and the purity of the moment and living right. Of my childhood in Abbott, Texas, to the Pacific Northwest, from Nashville to Hawaii and all the way back again. Of selling vacuum cleaners and encyclopedias while hosting radio shows and writing song after song, hoping to strike gold. It's a story of true love, wild times, best friends, and barrooms, with a musical sound track ripping right through it. My life gets lived on the road, at home, and on the road again, tried and true, and I've written it all down from my heart to yours.

Henry and Anne are bona fide soul mates, bound to each other through eternity.Still, in 1536, they are at the mercy of influences outside of their control, explosively incompatible, and caught in a marriage that ends in a betrayal so shocking that Anne requires lifetimes to recover.""Threads"", a reincarnation fantasy, opens with Anne's death in 1536.

Ultimately, to Anne's horror, he has made the decision to have her executed as well.Anne's fury at her husband's betrayal has enough momentum to survive centuries, but in ""Threads"" she learns that she has been assigned a hard task: she must forgive him.

A finales del siglo XIX, durante la última etapa zarista, los Zucker, perseguidos por ser judíos, tienen que abandonar Rusia huyendo del horror y la sinrazón. A su llegada a la Tierra Prometida, Samuel Zucker adquiere las tierras de los Ziad, una familia árabe encabezada por Ahmed.

13534,Charles Dickens|David Paroissien,"Charles Dickens's final, unfinished novel, and one that has puzzled readers and inspired writers since its publication, The Mystery of Edwin Drood is edited with an introduction by David Paroissien in Penguin Classics.Edwin Drood is contracted to marry orphan Rosa Bud when he comes of age, but when they find that duty has gradually replaced affection, they agree to break off the engagement. Shortly afterwards, in the middle of a storm on Christmas Eve, Edwin disappears, leaving nothing behind but some personal belongings and the suspicion that his jealous uncle John Jasper, madly in love with Rosa, is the killer. And beyond this presumed crime there are further intrigues: the dark opium dens of the sleepy cathedral town of Cloisterham, and the sinister double life of Choirmaster Jasper, whose drug-fuelled fantasy life belies his respectable appearance. Dickens died before completing The Mystery of Edwin Drood, leaving its tantalising mystery unsolved and encouraging successive generations of readers to turn detective.This edition contains an introduction by David Paroissien, discussing the novel's ending, with a chronology, notes, original illustrations by Samuel Luke Fildes, appendices on opium use in the nineteenth century, the 'Sapsea Fragment' and Dickens's plans for the story's conclusion.Charles Dickens is one of the best-loved novelists in the English language, whose 200th anniversary was celebrated in 2012.

3374,Charles Dickens|Norman Page,"The archetypal Victorian melodrama, as heartfelt and moving today as when it was first published, Charles Dickens's The Old Curiosity Shop is edited with notes and an introduction by Norman Page in Penguin Classics.Little Nell Trent lives in the quiet gloom of the old curiosity shop with her ailing grandfather, for whom she cares with selfless devotion. But when they are unable to pay their debts to the stunted, lecherous and demonic money-lender Daniel Quilp, the shop is seized and they are forced to flee, thrown into a shadowy world in which there seems to be no safe haven. Dickens's portrayal of the innocent, tragic Nell made The Old Curiosity Shop an instant bestseller that captured the hearts of the nation, even as it was criticised for its sentimentality by figures such as Oscar Wilde. Yet alongside the story's pathos are some of Dickens's greatest comic and grotesque creations: the ne'er-do-well Dick Swiveller, the mannish lawyer Sally Brass, the half-starved 'Marchioness' and the lustful, loathsome Quilp himself.This edition, based on the original text of 1841, contains an introduction by Norman Page discussing the various contrasting themes of the novel and its roots in Dickens's own personal tragedy, with prefaces to the 1841 and 1848 editions, a chronology, notes and original illustrations produced for the serial version.Charles Dickens is one of the best-loved novelists in the English language, whose 200th anniversary was celebrated in 2012.

10654,Voltaire|John Everett Butt,"Candide was the most brilliant challenge to the idea endemic in Voltaire's day, that 'all is for the best in the best possible worlds'.It was the indifferent shrug and callous intertia that this 'optimism' concealed which so angered Voltaire, who found the 'all for the best' approach a patently inadequate response to suffering, to natural disasters - such as the recent earthquakes in Lima and Lisbon - not to mention the questions of illness and man-made war. Moreover, as the rebel whose satiric genius had earned him not only international acclaim, but two stays in the Bastille, flogging and exile, Voltaire knew personally what suffering involved.In Candide he whisks his young hero and friends through a ludicrious variety of tortures, tragedies and reversals of fortune, in the company of Pangloss, a 'matapysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigologist' of unflinching optimism. The result is one of the glories of the eighteenth-century satire.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,144,3.76,190064,6330,Candide,Classics|Fiction|Philosophy|Cultural|France|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372171770l/385059.jpg,144,,,,,,,,,

10091,Thomas Mann,"Wenn irgendwann einmal ein Preis für den besten Buchtitel vergeben werden sollte, würde für mich Thomas Manns Zauberberg ganz oben auf die Liste gehören. Noch bevor ich das Buch gelesen hatte, weckte schon das Wort Neugier auf eine magische Welt. Nun, wer den Zauberberg kennt, weiß, daß dies kein Buch von fremden Feenwelten ist, und doch waltet hier eindeutig Magie. Die erste magische Leistung besteht darin, eine Handlung, die in einem Satz zusammengefaßt werden kann, auf 1.000 Seiten zu packen: Der junge Hamburger Hans Castorp, Sproß einer Patrizierfamilie lebt bis zum Ausbruch des ersten Weltkriegs sieben Jahre in einem Schweizer Luxussanatorium für Lungenkranke, ohne selbst krank zu sein. Die zweite magische Leistung ist Thomas Manns Sprache, die auch in tausend Jahren nichts von ihrer Kraft verloren haben wird. Die dritte magische Leistung ist die Behandlung der Figuren, die alle mehr mehr sind als bloße Protagonisten. Sie sind Exponate ihrer Zeit, jede für sich repräsentiert einen Teil geistigen Lebens in einer Ära, deren Ende sich vollzog während Thomas Mann am Zauberberg saß und schrieb. Die vierte magische Leistung schließlich, die zauberbergigste vielleicht, ist das Spiel mit dem Leser. Oder besser: das Spiel mit der Geschwindigkeit des Lesers. Thomas Mann erreicht, daß dem Leser zehn Minuten Lesen wie eine halbe Stunde Lesen vorkommen, und zwar genau dann, wenn Hans Castorp denkt, er habe eine halbe Stunde geträumt. Wie sich herausstellt, waren es zehn Minuten. Elf Jahre hat Thomas Mann an dem Buch geschrieben, das doch eigentlich nur eine Weiterführung des Themas aus Tod in Venedig sein sollte. Es wurde einer der meist gelesenen deutschen Romane.

19398,Raynor C. Johnson,"The title The Imprisoned Splendour derives from the author’s conviction that there is a world of unfolding ""spiritual"" potentiality interpenetrating the world of matter, and that to understand ourselves, and our relationship to nature and the creatures of the physical world we inhabit, this interpenetration must be philosophically considered.In this book, physicist, Raynor Johnson explores natural science, psychical research and mystical experience. The book is valuable for the serious and casual reader alike or anyone wishing to explore the mystical world of paranormal phenomena.Telepathy, clairvoyance, clairaudience, telekinesis, poltergeist phenomena, phantoms of the living and the dead, trance phenomena, automatic writing, and the evidence for the ""etheric body"" are all discussed, Johnson the Scientist is clearly a mystic at heart, and this makes for fascinating reading; No stone is left unturned and theological dogma is cast aside. Pre-existence is discussed in depth. Johnson explains,“If the general conception of evolution be regarded as applicable to the soul as well as to the physical world, it is not either improbable or unreasonable that the soul should adventure forth into the physical world in a newly-built body to acquire further experience of the kind which this world can provide. The fact that the soul has done so once was presumably for adequate and compelling reasons, and whatever these are, it is apparent that more might be gained by a series of such incarnations.”The imprisoned Splendour is deeply impressive and now considered a classic in psychical research literature.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,424,4,4,0,The Imprisoned Splendour,,,424,,,,,,,,,

He was the founder of the organization known as Comintern (Communist International) and the posthumous source of ""Leninism,"" the doctrine codified and conjoined with Marx's works by Lenin's successors to form Marxism-Leninism, which became the Communist world-view. If the Bolshevik Revolution is - as some people have called it - the most significant political event of the 20th century, then Lenin must for good or ill be regarded as the century's most significant political leader. Not only in the scholarly circles of the former Soviet Union but even among many non-Communist scholars, he has been regarded as the greatest revolutionary leader and revolutionary statesman in history, as well as the greatest revolutionary thinker since Marx.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,108,3.95,908,50,"Left-Wing Communism, an Infantile Disorder: A Popular Essay in Marxian Strategy and Tactics",Politics|Nonfiction|Philosophy|History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348201901l/483137.jpg,108,,,,,,,,,

Zewail,"From a beginning in an Egyptian delta town and the port of Alexandria to the scenic vistas of sunny southern California, Ahmed Zewail takes us on a voyage through time — his own life and the split-second world of the femtosecond. In this endearing exposé of his life and work until his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1999, he draws lessons from his life story so far, and he meditates on the impact which the revolution in science has had on our modern world — in both developed and developing countries. What makes the book enchanting and engaging is Zewail's emphasis on the human dimension and his unique ability to paint the journey of Life and Science with insightful analogies and ingenious metaphors.But this inspiring book goes far beyond the usual province of an autobiography. Zewail integrates the two worlds he equally belongs to — Egypt and America — and, despite differences, he emphasizes the confluence of the two cultures — the East and the West. He rejects the view that the current state of the world is due to a clash of civilizations or a conflict of religions, and suggests a concrete course of action for the world of the have-nots. The book ends with his road map for a partnership between developed and developing worlds. Throughout the book, Zewail takes on the mantle of philosopher, historian and even political and economic adviser.",,Paperback,9.79E+12,304,3.89,258,17,Voyage Through Time: Walks of Life to the Nobel Prize,Science|Nonfiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1266814377l/3674043.jpg,304,,,,,,,,,

28810,Elwood McQuaid,"Zvi is the biography of a man who, like his nation Israel, defies explanation apart from God. His story in the early stages is reminiscent of the Book of Esther in the Bible--God is not consciously represented, yet He is obviously present and at work. One will recognize, as the story unfolds, that people and events touched Zvi's life at strategic points in ways that cannot be coincidental. Over the tortuous course he followed in his flight for survival, the reader will discern a clear pattern of divine provision. Unlike many of the stories that confront us today, this true-life epic has a satisfying climax. Zvi's life is far from over, of course, but the issue has been settled. He is alive today and living a joyfully triumphant life in the land of his fathers. How he survived the Holocaust, found his way to the shores of Israel, and faced his life-transforming encounter with the Messiah is a story one can ill afford to miss. A careful study of his life is a revelation of the lengths to which a loving Lord will go to bring one soul safely home.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,202,4.35,201,24,Zvi,Biography|Nonfiction|Christian|World War II|Holocaust|History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1280267234l/3484728.jpg,202,,,,,,,,,

23218,James Luceno,"Throughout the galaxy, it was believed that Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker the Chosen One had died on Coruscant during the siege of the Jedi Temple. And, to some extent, that was true. Anakin was dead. From the site of Anakin Skywalker s last stand on the molten surface of the planet Mustafar, where he sought to destroy his friend and former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi a fearsome specter in black has risen. Once the most powerful Knight ever known to the Jedi Order, he is now a disciple of the dark side, a lord of the dreaded Sith, and the avenging right hand of the galaxy s ruthless new Emperor. Seduced, deranged, and destroyed by the machinations of the Dark Lord Sidious, Anakin Skywalker is dead . . . and Darth Vader lives. Word of the events that created him the Jedi Council s failed mutiny against Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the self-crowned Emperor s retaliatory command to exterminate the Jedi Order, and Anakin s massacre of his comrades and Masters in the Jedi Temple has yet to reach all quarters. On the Outer Rim world of Murkhana, Jedi Masters Roan Shryne and Bol Chatak and Padawan Olee Starstone are leading a charge on a Separatist stronghold, unaware that the tide, red with Jedi blood, has turned suddenly against them. When the three narrowly elude execution and become the desperate prey in a hunt across space it s neither clone soldiers, nor the newly deployed stormtroopers, nor even the wrath of the power-hungry Emperor himself they must fear most. The deadliest threat rests in the hideously swift and lethal crimson lightsaber of Darth Vader behind whose brooding mask lies a shattered heart, a poisoned soul, and a cunning, twisted mind hell-bent on vengeance. For the handful of scattered Jedi, survival is imperative if the light side of the Force is to be protected and the galaxy somehow, someday reclaimed. Yet more important still is the well-being of the twin infants, Leia and Luke Skywalker, the children of Anakin and his doomed bride, Padme Amidala. Separated after Padme s death, they must be made safe at all costs, lest the hope they represent for the future be turned to horror by the new Sith regime and the unspeakable power of the dark side.

51275,Gary J. Bass,"A riveting history—the first full account—of the involvement of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1971 atrocities in Bangladesh that led to war between India and Pakistan, shaped the fate of Asia, and left in their wake a host of major strategic consequences for the world today.Giving an astonishing inside view of how the White House really works in a crisis, The Blood Telegram is an unprecedented chronicle of a pivotal but little-known chapter of the Cold War. Gary J. Bass shows how Nixon and Kissinger supported Pakistan’s military dictatorship as it brutally quashed the results of a historic free election. The Pakistani army launched a crackdown on what was then East Pakistan (today an independent Bangladesh), killing hundreds of thousands of people and sending ten million refugees fleeing to India—one of the worst humanitarian crises of the twentieth century.Nixon and Kissinger, unswayed by detailed warnings of genocide from American diplomats witnessing the bloodshed, stood behind Pakistan’s military rulers. Driven not just by Cold War realpolitik but by a bitter personal dislike of India and its leader Indira Gandhi, Nixon and Kissinger actively helped the Pakistani government even as it careened toward a devastating war against India. They silenced American officials who dared to speak up, secretly encouraged China to mass troops on the Indian border, and illegally supplied weapons to the Pakistani military—an overlooked scandal that presages Watergate.Drawing on previously unheard White House tapes, recently declassified documents, and extensive interviews with White House staffers and Indian military leaders, The Blood Telegram tells this thrilling, shadowy story in full. Bringing us into the drama of a crisis exploding into war, Bass follows reporters, consuls, and guerrilla warriors on the ground—from the desperate refugee camps to the most secretive conversations in the Oval Office. Bass makes clear how the United States’ embrace of the military dictatorship in Islamabad would mold Asia’s destiny for decades, and confronts for the first time Nixon and Kissinger’s hidden role in a tragedy that was far bloodier than Bosnia. This is a revelatory, compulsively readable work of politics, personalities, military confrontation, and Cold War brinksmanship. ",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,528,4.29,1392,183,"The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide",History|Nonfiction|Politics|Cultural|India|War|Cultural|Pakistan|Cultural|Bangladesh,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1363836984l/17262102.jpg,528,,,,,,,,,

45433,Rachel Maddow,"""One of my favorite ideas is, never to keep an unnecessary soldier,"" Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1792. Neither Jefferson nor the other Found­ers could ever have envisioned the modern national security state, with its tens of thousands of ""privateers""; its bloated Department of Homeland Security; its rust­ing nuclear weapons, ill-maintained and difficult to dismantle; and its strange fascination with an unproven counterinsurgency doctrine. Written with bracing wit and intelligence, Rachel Maddow's Drift argues that we've drifted away from America's original ideals and become a nation weirdly at peace with perpetual war, with all the financial and human costs that entails. To understand how we've arrived at such a dangerous place, Maddow takes us from the Vietnam War to today's war in Afghanistan, along the way exploring the disturbing rise of executive authority, the gradual outsourcing of our war-making capabilities to private companies, the plummeting percentage of American families whose children fight our constant wars for us, and even the changing fortunes of G.I. Joe. She offers up a fresh, unsparing appraisal of Reagan's radical presidency. Ultimately, she shows us just how much we stand to lose by allowing the priorities of the national security state to overpower our political discourse. Sensible yet provocative, dead serious yet seri­ously funny, Drift will reinvigorate a ""loud and jangly"" political debate about how, when, and where to apply America's strength and power--and who gets to make those decisions.From the Hardcover edition.",,,9.78E+12,288,4.07,16172,1937,Drift: The Unmooring of American Military Power,Nonfiction|Politics|History|War|War|Military Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1318753897l/12143200.jpg,288,,,,,,,,,

'Our Riches in Christ' helps Christians understand the liberating, transforming truths that produce lasting joy, unbounded peace, and radiant faith. Throughout his thorough, verse-by-verse analysis of Paul's letter to the Ephesians, master teacher Ray Stedman stops often to show what the Scriptures mean for today's believer.

18008,Perry Belcher|Trisha Sebastian,"How to Start a Business is a conversational step-by-step guide to starting a small business. Inside you'll discover how to choose a business that's right for you, how to name your business, legal setup, leases, employees and more. The author Perry Belcher has started, ran and sold dozens of businesses and shares his experiences, mistakes and biggest breakthroughs.Does starting a business with a small amount of money sound too good to be true? No! There are many home based entrepreneurs who have successfully started their own businesses with little money. We’ve interviewed entrepreneurs who bootstrapped their businesses for as low as $500, yet they are now raking in money from their businesses. The lesson? Do things right! Of course, the ideal scenario is to start a business with enough money to enable you to move more aggressively and expand your business faster. But even if you do not have money, that should not prevent you from starting your own business. If you have great idea and a viable business plan, you can use Other People’s Money (OPM) to start your business. Or if you do not have access to OPM, you better learn how to tighten your belt and bootstrap your fledging business. Remember, while you may not be spending money, you still have to pay with something ­ your time and energy.Below are 10 areas Perry covers in his book:1. Think twice before borrowing. It would be ideal if you will not have to borrow money to start your business. After all, you want your own business to give you an additional source of income, if not the main paycheck. You do not need another bill to pay.But sometimes, you really have to borrow money to keep going. A major reason why many small businesses fail is inadequate capital. If you really have to, you must be prepared to take on the right kind of debt. Not all debt is bad debt. You have to ensure that before taking on a debt, you must see a way to pay it back through your business. As much as you want to be optimistic about your venture, there is always the possibility that your business can fail. Instead of fattening up your bank account, you could end up selling your house, your car and withdrawing your children’s college tuition just to pay off the debts. Be a smart risk taker.2. Be lean and mean. If you have limited capital, set aside any thoughts of a fancy store or great office. Start home-based and explore the advantages of working at home. Or if you must be “out there” selling your products, rent a small section at a flea market or fair. You may consider renting at the mall only when you see money coming in.In terms of legal structure, you can save tons of money by starting as a proprietorship. A Corporation is expensive to set-up, requires vast amounts of record-keeping, and will tax you twice ­ as an individual working for the business and as a corporation.Plus, you have to operate as tightly as possible. As a sole business owner on a budget, you do not have the luxury of wasting supplies, making unnecessary long-distance calls, and spending office money without a thought. Now every expense comes from your own pocket. Spend money only when you really have to. In fact, you can save tons of money if you select a business based on equipment that you already own. For example, consider starting a photography business if you already have your camera and photography gear. You may want to start a daycare business if you already have enough space in your house rather than spending money at the start of the business constructing new rooms in your house. If you must buy equipment, do so only when you have already landed your first account. Otherwise, consider renting it for the moment.3.

31675,John R.W. Stott,"The work of a lifetime, from one of the world's most influential thinkers, about the heart of the Christian faith. ""I could never myself believe in God, if it were not for the cross. . . . In the real world of pain, how could one worship a God who was immune to it?"" With compelling honesty John Stott confronts this generation with the centrality of the cross in God's redemption of the world -- a world now haunted by the memories of Auschwitz, the pain of oppression and the specter of nuclear war. Can we see triumph in tragedy, victory in shame? Why should an object of Roman distaste and Jewish disgust be the emblem of our worship and the axiom of our faith? And what does it mean for us today? Now from one of the foremost preachers and Christian leaders of our day comes theology at its readable best, a contemporary restatement of the meaning of the cross. At the cross Stott finds the majesty and love of God disclosed, the sin and bondage of the world exposed. More than a study of the atonement, this book brings Scripture into living dialogue with Christian theology and the twentieth century. What emerges is a pattern for Christian life and worship, hope and mission. Destined to be a classic study of the center of our faith, Stott's work is the product of a uniquely gifted pastor, scholar and Christian statesman. His penetrating insight, charitable scholarship and pastoral warmth are guaranteed to feed both heart and mind.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,380,4.26,9071,209,The Cross of Christ,Religion|Theology|Religion|Christianity|Nonfiction|Christian|Religion,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386925646l/73188.jpg,380,,,,,,,,,

But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys.

There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

37848,Martin McAvoy,"The Profession of Ignorance provides a readable discussion in dialogue form of the philosophy of ""ignorance"" as practiced by Socrates, who claimed a kind of knowledge of ignorance as human wisdom. Martin McAvoy shows that understanding this profession of ignorance is essential to understanding the character of Plato's Socrates. He begins by explaining that to comprehend this concept, Socrates' repeated claim that he is ignorant must be believed. In claiming this ignorance, Socrates claims a kind of knowledge. This knowledge of ignorance is the central paradox of Socrates' wisdom, generating his mission and elenchus. McAvoy presents the concept of thinking as a dialogue between knowledge and ignorance. In this dialogue, one asks as if ignorant, and one answers as if knowing. This very form questions the reality of knowledge. McAvoy questions the nature of knowledge, since it appears that one can not be sure exactly what is knowledge, but can recognize that it exists, though always ignorant of precisely what it is. He acknowledges and utilizes the presence of a double irony, that in an important sense, makes the profession of ignorance sincere. The use of the dialogue form reflects this double irony, and exhibits McAvoy's profession of ignorance as a claim to knowledge, just as in the case of Plato's.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,,4.5,2,1,The Profession of Ignorance: With Reference to Socrates,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1187750157l/1753345.jpg,,,,,,,,,,

21383,Héctor Tobar|Henry Leyva,"The exclusive, official story of the survival, faith, and family of Chile’s thirty-three trapped minersWhen the San José mine collapsed outside of Copiapó, Chile, in August 2010, it trapped thirty-three miners beneath thousands of feet of rock for a record-breaking sixty-nine days. Across the globe, we sat riveted to television and computer screens as journalists flocked to the Atacama desert. While we saw what transpired above ground during the grueling and protracted rescue, the story of the miners’ experiences below the earth’s surface—and the lives that led them there—hasn’t been heard until now.     In Deep Down Dark, a master work by a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist, Héctor Tobar gains exclusive access to the miners and their stories. The result is a miraculous and emotionally textured account of the thirty-three men who came to think of the San José mine as a kind of coffin, as a “cave” inflicting constant and thundering aural torment, and as a church where they sought redemption through prayer while the world watched from above. It offers an understanding of the families and personal histories that brought “los 33” to the mine, and the mystical and spiritual elements that surrounded working in such a dangerous place.",,Audio CD,9.78E+12,14,3.9,9613,1428,"Deep Down Dark: The Untold Stories of 33 Men Buried in a Chilean Mine, and the Miracle That Set Them Free",Nonfiction|Audiobook,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1409498752l/20696430.jpg,14,,,,,,,,,

The dog has been mankind's faithful companion for tens of thousands of years, yet today finds itself in crisis throughout the western world. Until just over a hundred years ago, most dogs worked for their living, and each of the many breeds had become well suited, over countless generations, to the task for which they were bred. Now, in their purely domestic roles we fail to understand their needs. And it is time that someone stood up for dogdom: not the caricature of the wolf in a dog suit, ready to dominate its unsuspecting owner at the first sign of weakness, not the trophy animal that collects rosettes and kudos for its breeder, but the real dog, the pet that just wants to be one of the family and enjoy life.

43831,Wassily Kandinsky|Hilla Rebay,"""I had the impression that here painting itself comes to the foreground; I wondered if it would not be possible to go further in this direction.""Thus did the young Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866–1944) react to his first viewing of Monet's Haystack, included in an 1895 Moscow exhibit of French Impressionists. It was his first perception of the dematerialization of an object and presaged the later development of his influential theories of non-objective art.During study and travel in Europe, the young artist breathed the heady atmosphere of artistic experimentation. Fauvism, Cubism, Symbolism, and other movements played an important role in the development of his own revolutionary approach to painting. Decrying literal representation, Kandinsky emphasized instead the importance of form, color, rhythm, and the artist's inner need in expressing reality.In Point and Line to Plane, one of the most influential books in 20th-century art, Kandinsky presents a detailed exposition of the inner dynamics of non-objective painting. Relying on his own unique terminology, he develops the idea of point as the ""proto-element"" of painting, the role of point in nature, music, and other art, and the combination of point and line that results in a unique visual language. He then turns to an absorbing discussion of line — the influence of force on line, lyric and dramatic qualities, and the translation of various phenomena into forms of linear expression. With profound artistic insight, Kandinsky points out the organic relationship of the elements of painting, touching on the role of texture, the element of time, and the relationship of all these elements to the basic material plane called upon to receive the content of a work of art.Originally published in 1926, this essay represents the mature flowering of ideas first expressed in Kandinsky's earlier seminal book, Concerning the Spiritual in Art. As an influential member of the Bauhaus school and a leading theoretician of abstract expressionism, Kandinsky helped formulate the modern artistic temperament. This book amply demonstrates the importance of his contribution and its profound effect on 20th-century art.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,192,3.93,855,35,Point and Line to Plane,Art|Nonfiction|Design|Art|Art History|Philosophy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408469531l/352807.jpg,192,,,,,,,,,

46232,Nadia Idle|Alex Nunns,"Egypt’s revolution as it unfolded, in the words of the people who made it.The Twitter accounts of the activists who brought heady days of revolution to Egypt in January and February this year paint an exhilarating picture of an uprising in real-time. Thousands of young people documented on cell phones every stage of their revolution, as it happened. This book brings together a selection of key tweets in a compelling, fast-paced narrative, allowing the story of the uprising to be told directly by the people in Cairo’s Tahrir Square.Many of the activists were “citizen journalists”, using Twitter to report what was happening. Others used the social network to organize, communicating the next steps necessary for the revolution to move forward. Nearly everyone online gave instant reactions to the extraordinary events occurring before their eyes. History has never before been written in this fashion. The tweet limit of 140 characters evidently concentrated the feelings of those using Twitter. Raw emotion bursts from their messages, whether frantic alarm at attacks from pro-government thugs or delirious happiness at the fall of the dictator.

In BETROTHED (Book #6 in the Vampire Journals), Caitlin and Caleb find themselves, once again, back in time—this time, in the London of 1599. London in 1599 is a wild place, filled with paradoxes: while on the one hand it is an incredibly enlightened, sophisticated time, breeding playwrights like Shakespeare, on the other, it is also barbaric and cruel, with daily public executions, torture, and heads of prisoners impaled on spikes. It is also a time of superstition and grave public danger, with a lack of sanitation, and the Bubonic Plague spreading in the streets, carried by rats. In this environment Caitlin and Caleb land, on the search for her father, for the third key, for the mythical shield that can save humankind. Their mission takes them through a whirlwind of London’s most amazing medieval architecture, through the British countryside’s most breathtaking castles. It takes them back into the heart of London, where they just might meet Shakespeare himself, and see one of his plays live. It brings them to a little girl, Scarlet, who just might become their daughter. And all the while, Caitlin’s love for Caleb deepens, as finally they are together—and as Caleb might just finally find the perfect time, and place, to propose to her. Sam and Polly have traveled back, too, and as they find themselves stuck together on their own journey, their relationship deepens, as they each, despite themselves, can’t help feeling more deeply for each other. But all is not well. Kyle has come back, too, as has his evil sidekick, Sergei, and they are both intent on destroying everything good in Caitlin’s life. It will be a race to the finish, as Caitlin is forced to make some of the hardest decisions of her life if she is to save everyone who is dear to her, save her relationship with Caleb—and try to make it out alive.

By turns horrifying and erotic, Perry’s new thriller takes us on a dangerous cat-and-mouse game that pits two women against each other: a beautiful serial killer and the detective who is determined to stop her.When the cousin of Los Angeles underworld figure Hugo Poole is found shot to death in his Portland, Oregon, home, police find nothing at the scene of the crime except several long strands of blond hair hinting that a second victim may have been involved. Hotel security tapes from the victim’s last vacation reveal an out-of-focus picture of a young blond woman entering and leaving his room. Could she also be a murder victim?Portland homicide detective Catherine Hobbes is determined to solve the case and locate the missing blonde, but her feelings, and the investigation, are complicated when Hugo hires private detective Joe Pitt to perform a parallel investigation. As Joe and Catherine form an uneasy alliance, the murder count rises–and both realize that the pretty young woman in the security tapes is not a victim at all. As Catherine follows the evidence, she finds herself in a deadly contest with an unpredictable adversary capable of changing her appearance and identity at will.

But as this definitive new biography makes clear, Gehrig’s life was more complicated—and, perhaps, even more heroic—than anyone really knew.Drawing on new interviews and more than two hundred   of previously unpublished letters to and from Gehrig, Luckiest Man gives us an intimate portrait of the man who became an American hero: his life as a shy and awkward youth growing up in New York City, his unlikely friendship with Babe Ruth (a friendship that allegedly ended over rumors that Ruth had had an affair with Gehrig’s wife), and his stellar career with the Yankees, where his consecutive-games streak stood for more than half a century. What was not previously known, however, is that symptoms of Gehrig’s affliction began appearing in 1938, earlier than is commonly acknowledged. Later, aware that he was dying, Gehrig exhibited a perseverance that was truly inspiring; he lived the last two years of his short life with the same grace and dignity with which he gave his now-famous “luckiest man” speech.Meticulously researched and elegantly written, Jonathan Eig’s Luckiest Man shows us one of the greatest baseball players of all time as we’ve never seen him before.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,432,4.2,4236,233,Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig,Sports and Games|Sports|Sports|Baseball|Biography|Nonfiction|History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1427577872l/59285.jpg,432,,,,,,,,,

In this illustrated That Sugar Book, Damon explains how sugar damages our bodies and our minds, and how easy it is to consume sugar without even knowing it. Revealing the astonishing amounts of sugar hidden in supposedly healthy foods on supermarket shelves - such as low-fat yoghurt, muesli and children's fruit snacks - Damon makes us realise the damage we unknowingly do to ourselves and our families when we make poor food choices, and shows us how to make it right. 

With an up-close account of Damon's sugar experiment, and sugar-free recipes to help you wean off the white stuff, That Sugar Book is a startling wake-up call to those of us who have never questioned what's really in our food.",,Kindle Edition,,331,4.15,657,85,That Sugar Book: This book will change the way you think about 'healthy' food,Nonfiction|Health|Food and Drink|Food|Health|Nutrition|Food and Drink|Cooking,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437455078l/25124559.jpg,331,,,,,,,,,
8932,Arkady Strugatsky|Boris Strugatsky|Аркадий Стругацкий|Борис Стругацкий,"Arkady and Boris Strugatsky are widely considered the greatest of Russian science fiction masters, and their most famous work, Roadside Picnic, has enjoyed great popularity worldwide. Yet the novel that was their own favorite, and that readers worldwide have acclaimed as their magnum opus, has never before been published in English. The Doomed City was so politically risky that the Strugatsky brothers kept its existence a complete secret even from their best friends for sixteen years after its completion in 1972. It was only published in Russia in the late 1980s, the last of their works to see publication. It was translated into a host of major European languages, and now appears in English in a major new translation by acclaimed translator Andrew Bromfield. The Doomed City is set in an experimental city bordered by an abyss on one side and an impossibly high wall on the other. Its sole inhabitants are people who were plucked from Earth's history and left to govern themselves under conditions established by Mentors whose purpose seems inscrutable. Andrei Voronin, a young astronomer plucked from Leningrad in the 1950s, is a die-hard believer in the Experiment, even though he's now a garbage collector. And as increasingly nightmarish scenarios begin to affect the city, he rises through the political hierarchy, with devastating effect.",,Paperback,,384,4.3,2504,126,Град обреченный,Science Fiction|Fiction|Cultural|Russia|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Fantasy|Literature|Russian Literature|Philosophy|Classics|Science Fiction Fantasy|Novels,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1371784034l/1567725.jpg,384,,,,,,,,,

But Camp Half-Blood Confidential explores much more than just the buildings and grounds. It includes info that can only be learned from those who live there.

26383,Osamu Dazai,"Indigno de ser humano es, dentro de la literatura japonesa, una de las novelas más relevantes del pasado siglo. Publicada en 1948, pocos meses antes del suicidio de Osamu Dazai, es una obra de tintes autobiográficos que describe el descenso a los infiernos de un hombre incapaz de avenirse a los usos de una sociedad hipócrita.El cuerpo de la novela lo componen los cuadernos escritos en primera persona por Yozo, el protagonista, que rememora su existencia desde su infancia. La narración en primera persona, que se detiene en detalles en apariencia intrascendentes pero capaces de poner de manifiesto la psicología del personaje, permite seguir el deterioro de una personalidad hipersensible al contacto con la hipocresía de la sociedad. Sin embargo, la degradación de Yozo es consecuencia de su incapacidad para adaptarse a los dictados de la sociedad; y esa incapacidad es percibida por el protagonista como una falla suya que jamás podrá superar. La narración logra con sutileza hacer hincapié en ese sentimiento de sentirse responsable de no haber sido capaz de comportarse como un ser humano. «Mi vida ha estado llena de vergüenza» comienzan sus apuntes, «La verdad es que no tengo la más remota idea de lo que es vivir como un ser humano».Desde temprana edad, el pequeño Yochan adivina que hay algo en él que le hace diferente de aquellos que le rodean, sean familiares, amigos o criados. La observación de las personas de su entorno pronto le lleva a descubrir que el egoísmo, la indiferencia y la conformidad son las cualidades de aquellos que por las noches son capaces de conciliar el sueño. Pero a Yozo le hace permanecer insomne la idea de que la maldad es una característica intrínseca del ser humano, una característica que le es necesaria para sobrevivir. La conciencia de esta realidad hace que el terror paralice al muchacho en sus intentos de establecer una relación sana con su entorno.El muchacho se refugia en lo que él mismo denomina “bufonería”, para desde ella acercarse a las personas de su entorno. Desarrollando sus dotes histriónicas, Yochan levanta una barrera de humor entre su persona y la maldad de los seres humanos. Convencido de que mientras estén ocupados riéndose con él (o de él, el matiz resulta indiferente) no podrán hacerle daño, el narrador vive una vida de payaso a pesar del miedo indescriptible que le atenaza.La tensión provocada por ese necesario fingimiento, por esa división entre la cara divertida que muestra al mundo y el terrible pánico que le atenaza, es el eje sobre el que pivota la novela; así como la explicación para la degradación que Yozo sufrirá cuando abandone su provincia de origen y el ambiente de la casa familiar —que él siempre ha juzgado opresivo—, para cursar estudios superiores en Tokio.Allí conoce a Horiki, un joven mayor que él que le resulta atractivo por su vida licenciosa. Aunque Yozo comprende que, como del resto, le separa de Horiki su conciencia de la farsa del mundo, al menos éste vive en cierto modo, y gracias a su depravación, alejado de los convencionalismos de una sociedad podrida. De este modo, Yochan acepta a Horiki como un simple compañero de diversión que le descubrirá las delicias del libertinaje. Gracias al alcohol y las drogas, Yozo logra olvidar su terror a la gente y relacionarse con los demás de una manera más natural. Sin embargo, la realidad que descubrió ya en su niñez sigue latente en su interior, de modo que cada vez necesitará dosis más grandes de alcohol y morfina para hacer frente a ese pavor, hasta acabar en un sanatorio mental.",,Paperback,,124,4.08,11189,920,Indigno de ser humano,Fiction|Cultural|Japan|Asian Literature|Japanese Literature|Classics|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340459840l/15718542.jpg,124,,,,,,,,,

47686,Eve Ensler,"Botox, bulimia, breast implants: Eve Ensler, author of the international sensation The Vagina Monologues, is back, this time to rock our view of what it means to have a “good body.” “In the 1950s,” Eve writes, girls were “pretty, perky. They had a blond Clairol wave in their hair. They wore girdles and waist-pinchers. . . . In recent years good girls join the army. They climb the corporate ladder. They go to the gym. . . . They wear painful pointy shoes. They don’t eat too much. They . . . don’t eat at all. They stay perfect. They stay thin. I could never be good.”The Good Body starts with Eve’s tortured relationship with her own “post-forties” stomach and her skirmishes with everything from Ab Rollers to fad diets and fascistic trainers in an attempt get the “flabby badness” out. As Eve hungrily seeks self-acceptance, she is joined by the voices of women from L.A. to Kabul, whose obsessions are also laid bare: A young Latina candidly critiques her humiliating “spread,” a stubborn layer of fat that she calls “a second pair of thighs.” The wife of a plastic surgeon recounts being systematically reconstructed–inch by inch–by her “perfectionist” husband. An aging magazine executive, still haunted by her mother’s long-ago criticism, describes her desperate pursuit of youth as she relentlessly does sit-ups.Along the way, Eve also introduces us to women who have found a hard-won peace with their bodies: an African mother who celebrates each individual body as signs of nature’s diversity; an Indian woman who transcends “treadmill mania” and delights in her plump cheeks and curves; and a veiled Afghani woman who is willing to risk imprisonment for a taste of ice cream. These are just a few of the inspiring stories woven through Eve’s global journey from obsession to enlightenment. Ultimately, these monologues become a personal wake-up call from Eve to love the “good bodies” we inhabit.From the Hardcover edition.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,112,3.68,1899,195,The Good Body,Feminism|Nonfiction|Plays|Womens|Gender|Gender Studies|Drama,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428178281l/531495.jpg,112,,,,,,,,,

13275,Timothy Zahn,"It began as the ultimate voyage of discovery–only to become the stuff of lost Republic legend . . . and a dark chapter in Jedi history. Now, at last, acclaimed author Timothy Zahn returns to tell the whole extraordinary story of the remarkable–and doomed–Outbound Flight Project.The Clone Wars have yet to erupt when Jedi Master Jorus C’baoth petitions the Senate for support of a singularly ambitious undertaking. Six Jedi Masters, twelve Jedi Knights, and fifty thousand men, women, and children will embark–aboard a gargantuan vessel, equipped for years of travel–on a mission to contact intelligent life and colonize undiscovered worlds beyond the known galaxy. The government bureaucracy threatens to scuttle the expedition before it can even start–until Master C’baoth foils a murderous conspiracy plot, winning him the political capital he needs to set in motion the dream of Outbound Flight.Or so it would seem. For unknown to the famed Jedi Master, the successful launch of the mission is secretly being orchestrated by an unlikely ally: the evil Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, who has his own reasons for wanting Outbound Flight to move forward . . . and, ultimately, to fail. Yet Darth Sidious is not the mission’s most dangerous challenge. Once underway, the starship crosses paths at the edge of Unknown Space with the forces of the alien Chiss Ascendancy and the brilliant mastermind best known as “Thrawn.” Even Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, aboard Outbound Flight with his young Padawan student, Anakin Skywalker, cannot help avert disaster. Thus what begins as a peaceful Jedi mission is violently transformed into an all-out war for survival against staggering odds–and the most diabolical of adversaries.Timothy Zahn’s unique mix of espionage, political gamesmanship, and deadly interstellar combat breathes electrifying life into a Star Wars legend.From the Hardcover edition.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,480,3.91,10230,363,Outbound Flight,Media Tie In|Star Wars|Science Fiction|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405546347l/192523.jpg,480,,,,,,,,,

49935,Kathleen Winter,"Award-winning Canadian author Kathleen Winter’s Annabel is a stunning debut novel about the family of a mixed-gendered child born into a rural hunting community in the 1960s.Kathleen Winter’s luminous debut novel is a deeply affecting portrait of life in an enchanting seaside town and the trials of growing up unique in a restrictive environment. In 1968, into the devastating, spare atmosphere of Labrador, Canada, a child is born: a baby who appears to be neither fully boy nor fully girl, but both at once. Only three people are privy to the secret—the baby’s parents, Jacinta and Treadway, and their trusted neighbor and midwife, Thomasina. Though Treadway makes the difficult decision to raise the child as a boy named Wayne, the women continue to quietly nurture the boy’s female side. And as Wayne grows into adulthood within the hypermasculine hunting society of his father, his shadow-self, a girl he thinks of as “Annabel,” is never entirely extinguished. When Wayne finally escapes the confines of his hometown and settles in St. John’s, the anonymity of the city grants him the freedom to confront his dual identity. His ultimate choice will once again call into question the integrity and allegiance of those he loves most. Kathleen Winter has crafted a literary gem about the urge to unveil mysterious truth in a culture that shuns contradiction, and the body’s insistence on coming home. A daringly unusual debut full of unforgettable beauty, Annabel introduces a remarkable new voice to American readers.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,464,3.83,10107,1343,Annabel,Fiction|Cultural|Canada|Lgbt|Contemporary,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328033308l/7984373.jpg,464,,,,,,,,,

39106,Henry H. Neff,"The Tapestry series continues to weave threads of fantasy, mythology, science fiction, and mystery into a wholly original adventure that appeals to fans of everything from Harry Potter to Lord of the Rings to The X-Men. Genre-blending and fully illustrated, The Tapestry novels have caught the attention of middle-grade and young adult readers alike—and the series is only getting bigger.Book One, The Hound of Rowan, was a boarding-school fantasy that School Library Journal called “a solid and worthwhile beginning . . . [that] should help ease the suffering once Harry Potter withdrawal sets in.” Book Two, The Second Siege, was an epic quest about which Kirkus Reviews said, “After devouring this title, young fans will clamor for more.”Book Three, The Fiend and the Forge, is an unforgettable dystopian adventure across a landscape overrun with goblins and trolls. The world has changed almost beyond recognition, for with the Book of Origins firmly in his possession, the villainous Astaroth now has the power to reshape history at will. Plucking pivotal discoveries from mankind’s past, he has reduced the world to a preindustrial nightmare.But while most humans toil as slaves within four demonic kingdoms, Astaroth allows those at Rowan to thrive in peaceful isolation. Theirs is a land where magic and nature flourish . . . so long as none dare oppose the new order.That proves too steep a price for Max McDaniels. Unsure of his place at Rowan, Max sets out to explore the shifting landscape of the world beyond. In the course of his travels, he will become many things: Prisoner. Gladiator. Assassin. But can he become the hero that mankind so desperately needs?In the third book of The Tapestry, author–illustrator Henry H.

25497,Lena Michell,"La rebeldía es un acto de la consciencia que se hace contra algo que se quiere cambiar. Pero también se apaga con la misma rapidez e intensidad con la que surge: los guerreros rebeldes dejan de serlo cuando toman el poder; los artistas, cuando su obra es aceptada. Desde ese punto de vista, no puede decirse que Olivia Hamilton se rebele. Ella, simplemente, es distinta, y nada puede hacerla cambiar. Si usa ropa de varón, lo hace ya que resulta más cómoda para montar; si se duerme en clase, se debe a que no quiere saber la aburrida lista de formas de cortesía con la que tiene que dirigirse a un conde o a un duque; si dice las cosas tal cual son, es porque detesta la hipocresía. De eso, claro, hay mucho en el colegio de señoritas en el que está recluida por decisión de sus padres con el objetivo de encauzarla. Alexander Sinclair, duque de Ashford, mentor del internado para muchachas que está en sus tierras, sonríe una o dos veces al año. Con un pasado sombrío, con varios desengaños a cuestas, apenas se interesa por las mujeres lo justo como para saciar sus necesidades y aspirar a que una le provea un heredero. Sin embargo, se cruzará con Olivia y el impacto será como el de un choque de planetas: nada de lo conocido podía prepararlos para ese encuentro en el que el carácter y la sensualidad desbordarán. La escena está preparada, la trama dispuesta con la claridad que puede ver una quiromántica que sepa leer la línea del corazón de las manos de Olivia y Alexander.

50939,Stephen Hawking,"One of the most influential thinkers of our time, Stephen Hawking is an intellectual icon, known not only for the adventurousness of his ideas but for the clarity and wit with which he expresses them. In this new book Hawking takes us to the cutting edge of theoretical physics, where truth is often stranger than fiction, to explain in laymen's terms the principles that control our universe. Like many in the community of theoretical physicists, Professor Hawking is seeking to uncover the grail of science - the elusive Theory of Everything that lies at the heart of the cosmos. In his accessible and often playful style, he guides us on his search to uncover the secrets of the universe - from supergravity to supersymmetry, from quantum theory to M-theory, from holography to duality. He takes us to the wild frontiers of science, where superstring theory and p-branes may hold the final clue to the puzzle. And he lets us behind the scenes of one of his most exciting intellectual adventures as he seeks ""to combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe."" With characteristic exuberance, Professor Hawking invites us to be fellow travelers on this extraordinary voyage through space-time. Copious four-color illustrations help clarify this journey into a surreal wonderland where particles, sheets, and strings move in eleven dimensions; where black holes evaporate and disappear, taking their secret with them; and where the original cosmic seed from which our own universe sprang was a tiny nut. The Universe in a Nutshell is essential reading for all of us who want to understand the universe in which we live.

Trabaja como director de una funeraria en una pequeña población de Michigan donde se encarga de los entierros, cremaciones y actos fúnebres de su comunidad.En este libro las dos vocaciones se encuentran y Lynch se revela a la vez como competente funcionario del duelo y como escritor, que de manera conmovedora sintoniza el lenguaje con las fibras de la liberación interior.Con homenajes a los padres que han muerto y a los hijos que no debieron morir, con retratos de hipocondríacos, amantes y suicidas, El enterrador despliega una increíble gama de matices que van desde lo solemne, lo nostálgico y lo lírico, a lo mordaz y lo intensamente vivaz.",,,9.79E+12,258,3.93,2377,374,El enterrador,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Death|Writing|Essays|Biography|Philosophy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1291725252l/9813838.jpg,258,,,,,,,,,

The survivor of a troubled childhood, he has taken refuge in the world of books and spends his nights spinning baroque tales about the city’s underworld. But perhaps his dark imaginings are not as strange as they seem, for in a locked room deep within the house lie photographs and letters hinting at the mysterious death of the previous owner. Like a slow poison, the history of the place seeps into his bones as he struggles with an impossible love. Close to despair, David receives a letter from a reclusive French editor, Andreas Corelli, who makes him the offer of a lifetime. He is to write a book unlike anything that has ever existed—a book with the power to change hearts and minds. In return, he will receive a fortune, and perhaps more. But as David begins the work, he realizes that there is a connection between his haunting book and the shadows that surround his home.Once again, Zafón takes us into a dark, gothic universe first seen in the Shadow of the Wind and creates a breathtaking adventure of intrigue, romance, and tragedy.

Sensitive, whimsical, possessed of an extraordinary and powerful imagination, she spends hours writing haiku, reading Shakespeare, or simply hiding in the dark warmth of the airing cupboard. As the child of an English father and a Nigerian mother, Jess just can't shake off the feeling of being alone wherever she goes, and the other kids in her class are wary of her tendency to succumb to terrified fits of screaming. Believing that a change from her English environment might be the perfect antidote to Jess's alarming mood swings, her parents whisk her off to Nigeria for the first time where she meets her mother's family--including her formidable grandfather. Jess's adjustment to Nigeria is only beginning when she encounters Titiola, or TillyTilly, a ragged little girl her own age.

But gradually, TillyTilly's visits become more disturbing, making Jess start to realize that she doesn't know who TillyTilly is at all.

Un itinerario a través de la locura y la muerte, que desemboca en una estilizadísima violencia, narrado, a la vez con autoironía y lirismo desenfrenado, por el propio Humbert Humbert. Lolita es también un retrato ácido y visionario de los Estados Unidos, de los horrores suburbanos y de la cultura del plástico y del motel.

12610,Jack Womack,"With his vivid, stylized prose, cyberpunk intensity, and seemingly limitless imagination, Jack Womack has been compared to both William Gibson and Kurt Vonnegut - though Gibson admits, ""If you dropped the characters from Neuromancer into Womack's Manhattan, they'd fall down screaming and have nervous breakdowns"". Random Acts of Senseless Violence, Womack's fifth novel, is a thrilling, hysterical, and eerily disturbing piece ot work. Lola Hart is an ordinary twelve-year-old girl. She comes from a comfortable family, attends an exclusive private school, loves her friends Lori and Katherine, teases her sister Boob. But in the increasingly troubled city where she lives (a near-future Manhattan) she is a dying breed. Riots, fire, TB outbreaks, roaming gangs, increasing inflation, political and civil unrest all threaten her way of life, as well as the very fabric of New York City. In her diary, Lola chronicles the changes she and her family make as they attempt to adjust to a city, and a country, that is spinning out of control. Her mother is a teacher, but no one is hiring. Her father is a writer, but no one is buying his scripts. Hounded by creditors and forced to vacate their apartment and move to Harlem, her family, and her life, begins to dissolve. Increasingly estranged from her privileged school friends, Lola soon makes new ones: Iz, Jude, and Weezie - wise veterans of the street who know what must be done in order to survive and are more than willing to do it. And the metamorphosis of Lola Hart, who is surrounded by the new language and violence of the streets, begins. Simultaneously chilling and darkly hilarious, Random Acts of Senseless Violence takes the jittery urban fears we suppress, both in fiction and in daily life, and makes them explicit - and explicitly terrifying.--Publisher/Powells.com",,Paperback,9.78E+12,256,3.96,1916,270,Random Acts of Senseless Violence,Science Fiction|Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Science Fiction|Cyberpunk,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348132999l/1129928.jpg,256,,,,,,,,,

In return for twenty-four years of unparalleled musical accomplishment, he bargains away his soul - and the ability to love his fellow man.Leverkühn's life story is a brilliant allegory of the rise of the Third Reich, of Germany's renunciation of its own humanity and its embrace of ambition and its nihilism. It is also Mann's most profound meditation on the German genius - both national and individual - and the terrible responsibilities of the truly great artist.",,Hardcover,,510,4.08,8454,424,Doctor Faustus,European Literature|German Literature|Cultural|Germany|Classics,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343609395l/15730198.jpg,510,,,,,,,,,

The life of a woman today isn't really all that different from that of Mary and Martha in the New Testament. Like Mary, you long to sit at the Lord's feet...but the daily demands of a busy world just won't leave you alone. Like Martha, you love Jesus and really want to serve him...yet you struggle with weariness, resentment, and feelings of inadequacy. Then comes Jesus, right into the midst of your busy Mary/Martha life-and he extends the same invitation he issued long ago to the two sisters of Bethany. Tenderly he invites you to choose ""the better part""-a joyful life of ""living-room"" intimacy with him that flows naturally into ""kitchen service"" for him. How can you make that choice? With her fresh approach to the familiar Bible story and its creative, practical strategies, Joanna shows how all of us -Marys and Marthas alike- can draw closer to our Lord, deepening our devotion, strengthening our service, and doing both with less stress and greater joy.

44530,Jeremy Bentham|Tobias Skinneer,"*In this edition hundreds of problems in punctuation and spelling that frustrated reading have been corrected (British spellings have been left alone).*Contains a new Forward by Tobias Skinner.*In Not Paul, But Jesus Jeremy Bentham offers solid proof that the books of the Bible ascribed to Paul could not have been divinely inspired due to the numerous fallacies and contradictions contained within them. Indeed, argues Bentham, Paul's works even contradict the teachings of Christ. It is likely the books ascribed to Paul, many of which are merely letters to early Christian churches, were added by the church because the doctrine of Paul allows the church to play a far larger role in the life of Christians than would be the case without the books included. Paul wanted the various churches he visited to practice Christianity his way. His letters tell them to do so, and apparently some influential leaders of the early and later church approved. Whatever the case, Bentham offers convincing proof that an infallible God could not have inspired the writings of Paul, which are far from infallible.

28322,Erik Larson,"Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America’s rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair’s brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country’s most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his “World’s Fair Hotel” just west of the fairgrounds — a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake'The Devil in the White City' draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others.In this book the smoke, romance, and mystery of the Gilded Age come alive as never before. Erik Larson’s gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.To find out more about this book, go to http://www.DevilInTheWhiteCity.com.",,Kindle Edition,,447,3.99,410966,28491,"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America",Nonfiction|History|Crime|True Crime|Mystery|Crime|Historical|Mystery|North American Hi...|American History|Audiobook|Biography|Book Club,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1514387903l/5711242.jpg,447,,,,,,,,,

12540,Fernando Savater,"En esta obra de notable éxito, aparecida en 1991, su autor, el conocido filósofo Fernando Savater (San Sebastián, 1947), reflexiona acerca de lo que denomina el «arte de vivir que es la ética» dirigiéndose a un joven receptor de 16 años (su hijo Amador). Tal circunstancia hace que el lenguaje utilizado sea accesible a los adolescentes, ya que se aleja de lo que son los textos especializados demasiado técnicos.La idea principal del libro se puede resumir en que los seres humanos queremos darnos «la buena vida». Esta aspiración es posible y para conseguirla debemos ineludiblemente hacer uso de nuestra libertad. Sin embargo, la clave está en cómo usar ese libre albedrío, ya que al tener que tomar decisiones podemos equivocarnos. Ahí es donde radica el aprendizaje de la ética. La buena vida no puede ser otra cosa que buena vida humana. Por lo tanto, todos nuestros pasos deberían ir encaminados a ser felices, sin perjudicar a los demás. Lo que Savater plantea es la necesidad de dar un trato humano a los otros (y recibirlo de ellos). Para lograrlo, recomienda aprender a ponernos en su lugar. A lo largo del libro el razonamiento avanza intentando que el lector medite sobre cómo actuamos y cómo deberíamos actuar con nosotros mismos y con nuestros semejantes, para hacer lo que nos resulte más conveniente en la vida, teniendo en cuenta que la mayor gratificación que podemos obtener es alegría; de modo que todo lo que nos aleje de la alegría es un camino equivocado.El hecho de que Savater se dirija a su hijo adolescente condiciona el nivel del lenguaje empleado. De ahí la abundancia de expresiones coloquiales que facilitan la comprensión de las ideas. Además, el autor ejemplifica los argumentos mediante alusiones a personajes históricos, literarios, cinematográficos, etc. De este modo, desfilan por sus páginas Calígula, Esaú y Jacob, Héctor y Aquiles, Robinson Crusoe, Ciudadano Kane, Pepito Grillo, Marta Sánchez y muchos más. En suma, resulta un libro de fácil y amena lectura.",,Paperback,9.79E+12,191,3.59,4213,235,Ética para Amador,Philosophy|Nonfiction|Academic|School,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1371252480l/112646.jpg,191,,,,,,,,,

10235,Margaret Cheney,"In this “informative and delightful” (American Scientist) biography, Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of Nikola Tesla, one of the twentieth century’s greatest scientists and inventors.In Tesla: Man Out of Time, Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of one of the twentieth century's greatest scientists and inventors. Called a madman by his enemies, a genius by others, and an enigma by nearly everyone, Nikola Tesla was, without a doubt, a trailblazing inventor who created astonishing, sometimes world-transforming devices that were virtually without theoretical precedent. Tesla not only discovered the rotating magnetic field -- the basis of most alternating-current machinery -- but also introduced us to the fundamentals of robotics, computers, and missile science. Almost supernaturally gifted, unfailingly flamboyant and neurotic, Tesla was troubled by an array of compulsions and phobias and was fond of extravagant, visionary experimentations. He was also a popular man-about-town, admired by men as diverse as Mark Twain and George Westinghouse, and adored by scores of society beauties.  From Tesla's childhood in Yugoslavia to his death in New York in the 1940s, Cheney paints a compelling human portrait and chronicles a lifetime of discoveries that radically altered -- and continue to alter -- the world in which we live. Tesla: Man Out of Time is an in-depth look at the seminal accomplishments of a scientific wizard and a thoughtful examination of the obsessions and eccentricities of the man behind the science.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,400,3.78,3652,382,Tesla: Man Out of Time,Biography|Nonfiction|Science|History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348337739l/128529.jpg,400,,,,,,,,,

25298,Amber Lea Easton,"""Understanding suffering always helps the energy of compassion to be born."" ~ Thich Nhat Hanh In an instant my husband stripped away my identity as wife, stay-at-home mom, and best friend. With his suicide, our world changed forever. He'd been the center of our universe, but then he was gone. Grief is a dark journey, one often tainted with judgment and false perceptions. Add the word 'suicide' to the mix and more complications arise. This memoir, Free Fall, is intended for those who may be facing their own tragedy and feeling alone, hopeless, confused, scared, and misunderstood. Free Fall is the journey of piecing our lives back together—overcoming children's anxiety as we traversed the brutal grief and trauma process, learning to say the words 'widow' and 'single mom' without cringing, surviving the fall out with friends and family who simply couldn't understand our healing process, triumphing over the stigma of 'suicide', forgiving my husband, and finding peace after chaos. Free Fall is for widows, widowers, parents, survivors of suicide, family members or friends of one who mourns. This story is for anyone who needs encouragement that there is another side to grief. There is. We're there now. We're looking back and holding our hands out to you saying, ""hang in there, you're not alone, and you'll get here, too.""",,Paperback,9.78E+12,128,4.46,129,16,Free Fall,Autobiography|Memoir|Inspirational|Nonfiction|Biography,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1378155971l/18430056.jpg,128,,,,,,,,,

Jaspers used the occasion to offer an account of the cultural and intellectual situation from which existentialism emerged as well as a summary of his own philosophy.The book serves three purposes today: it brings the many strands of the existential movement into focus; it provides an overview of Jaspers's own philosophical position; and it demonstrates by example that philosophy need not be irrational, antiscientific, journalistic, or homiletic in order to be existential and engage. In this short book Jaspers provides a corrective for the popular view of existentialism as a pessimistic, irrationalist philosophy.

5360,Mary Karr,"When it was published in 1995, Mary Karr's The Liars Club took the world by storm and raised the art of the memoir to an entirely new level, as well as bringing about a dramatic revival of the form. Karr's comic childhood in an east Texas oil town brings us characters as darkly hilarious as any of J. D. Salinger's—a hard-drinking daddy, a sister who can talk down the sheriff at twelve, and an oft-married mother whose accumulated secrets threaten to destroy them all. Now with a new introduction that discusses her memoir's impact on her family, this unsentimental and profoundly moving account of an apocalyptic childhood is as ""funny, lively, and un-put-downable"" (USA Today) today as it ever was.",10th anniversary ed.,Paperback,9.78E+12,320,3.93,52641,2526,The Liars' Club,Autobiography|Memoir|Nonfiction|Biography,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1499665766l/14241.jpg,320,,,,,,,,,
26792,Milena Wójtowicz,"Wydawałoby się, że bycie królewną to niezbyt skomplikowana sprawa. Ale bycie królewną i czarownicą…O, to już jest znacznie trudniejsze! Szczególnie, gdy dookoła czają się groźne demony i „życzliwi” doradcy czekający jakby tu przejąć władzę.Salianka miała cechy prawdziwej królewny, w tym przede wszystkim próżność, oraz cechę prawdziwej czarownicy – umiała wykorzystywać magię by, osiągnąć swój cel. Jednak najważniejszą cechą Salianki, która ją zdecydowanie wyróżniała wśród innych, były wrota, które zadomowiły się w jej umyśle i stanowiły prawdziwą bramę do piekieł. Otwierały się tylko na „specjalne” okazje by uwięzić wszelkie pomioty zła. Królewna, mając tak ogromny potencjał złych mocy, siała prawdziwy postrach i nic dziwnego, że świadoma swojej władzy zaczęła podbijać sąsiednie krainy. Był jednak pewien mankament. Wrota potrafiły działać bez zgody swojej pani, przejmując niekiedy całkowicie władzę nad jej umysłem i ciałem. Stąd był już tylko krok do opętania, a łatwo się domyślić, co może się stać z krainą rządzoną przez opętaną czarownicę.Powieść Mileny Wójtowicz nosi wszelkie znamiona bajki. Ale jest to wyjątkowo przewrotna bajka. Królewna wcale nie jest piękna, jej największym zagrożeniem nie są obcy wojownicy, lecz egzorcyści, i nawet żaba podająca się za księcia tak naprawdę jest tylko zaczarowanym pastuchem.

My aunt, the Queen of Air and Darkness, no long distracted by her sadistic pastimes, now focusses unwaveringly on me. I spend each night with my immortal guards, but still no child has come of our decadent pleasures. But something IS happening to me.

Dexter (Hex) Raitliffe, a freelance publicist, returns home to care for his mother, Billie, who is dying by inches of a neurological disease that will rob her of motion, of speech, and finally of thought. Billie's second husband has left her--a fact that Hex is unaware of until he comes home--and her only hope for assisted suicide lies in her son. Unfortunately, Hex is barely able to conduct his own life, much less take his mother's. Purple America takes place over the course of a single night; in that night, Hex gives his mother a bath, reconnects with an old love, gets drunk, and goes after his stepfather to confront him, with tragic results. As Moody weaves his tale of this fateful Friday evening, he juxtaposes themes of aging, obsolescence, and physical decline with an accident at the nuclear power plant where his stepfather works. What lifts this novel above its rather depressing subject matter is Moody's unsentimental storytelling and the soaring language with which he gives his characters voice. Purple America is by turns lyrical, tragic, ferocious, and funny, and Rick Moody is a writer with a brilliant future ahead of him.",,Mass Market Paperback,9.78E+12,374,3.47,894,80,Purple America,Fiction|Literary Fiction|Novels|Abandoned,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1166672342l/15376.jpg,374,,,,,,,,,

31541,Neal Gabler,"From Neal Gabler, the definitive portrait of one of the most important figures in twentieth-century American entertainment and cultural history.Seven years in the making and meticulously researched - Gabler is the first writer to be given complete access to the Disney archives - this is the full story of a man whose work left an ineradicable brand on our culture but whose life has largely been enshrouded in myth.Gabler shows us the young Walt Disney breaking free of a heartland childhood of discipline and deprivation and making his way to Hollywood. We see the visionary, whose desire for escape honed an innate sense of what people wanted to see on the screen and, when combined with iron determination and obsessive perfectionism, led him to the reinvention of animation. It was Disney, first with Mickey Mouse and then with his feature films - most notably Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi - who transformed animation from a novelty based on movement to an art form that presented an illusion of life.We see him reimagine the amusement park with Disneyland, prompting critics to coin the word Disneyfication to describe the process by which reality can be modified to fit one's personal desires. At the same time, he provided a new way to connect with American history through his live-action films and purveyed a view of the country so coherent that even today one can speak meaningfully of ""Walt Disney's America."" We see how the True-Life Adventure nature documentaries he produced helped create the environmental movement by sensitizing the general public to issues of conservation. And we see how he reshaped the entertainment industry by building a synergistic empire that combined film, television, theme parks, music, book publishing, and merchandise in a way that was unprecedented and was later widely imitated.Gabler also reveals a wounded, lonely, and often disappointed man, who, despite worldwide success, was plagued with financial problems much of his life, suffered a nervous breakdown, and at times retreated into pitiable seclusion in his workshop making model trains. Gabler explores accusations that Disney was a red-baiter, an anti-Semite, an embittered alcoholic. But whatever the characterizations of Disney's personal life, he appealed to the nation by demonstrating the power of wish fulfillment and the triumph of the American imagination. Walt Disney showed how one could impose one's will on the world.This is a masterly biography, a revelation of both the work and the man - of both the remarkable accomplishment and the hidden life.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,851,4.12,6412,528,Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination,Biography|Nonfiction|History|Business,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353778664l/118824.jpg,851,,,,,,,,,

He is chosen by a group of scientists to create a philosophy for a computer-generated world exactly like ours. Much to his frustration every model he introduces—from Darwinism, to Existentialism, to Relativism, to Buddhism—fails. The only way to preserve the computer world is to introduce laws from outside their system through a Law Giver. Of course this goes against everything he's ever believed, and he hates it. But even that doesn't completely work because the citizens of that world become legalists and completely miss the spirit behind the Law.

Written in the wake of some highly publicized school shootings, Big Mouth & Ugly Girl takes a look at the shock waves that emanate from an overheard comment muttered in sarcasm, and the overzealous reaction of the school and surrounding community that follows. High school junior Matt Donaghy is considered an okay guy. He gets good grades, writes for the school paper, is in the Drama Club, and is known for his witty, if immature, humor. Students and teachers seem to like him. But one day he says something that makes a few classmates think he's out to bomb the school. The school principal is notified, the police are called in, and rumors are abuzz. Even his buddies doubt his innocence, and none of the guys come forward in his defense. There is, however, someone else who overheard Matt's statement and understood his mocking intent. School renegade Ursula Riggs, or ""Ugly Girl"" as she refers to herself, doesn't know Matt very well but reveals what she heard and the context in which it was said -- even though her parents instruct her to mind her own business. But even if Ursula can help Matt clear up this misunderstanding, will life at Rocky River High School ever be the same again? In her first novel for young adults, acclaimed author Joyce Carol Oates delivers a striking story about friendship, family, community, support, betrayal, and self-confidence.

28894,Arthur Schopenhauer|Thomas Bailey Saunders,"A leading German metaphysician of the 19th century, Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) exerted an influence far beyond the hermetic world of philosophy, with adherents ranging from Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche to Leo Tolstoy and Thomas Mann. Among Schopenhauer's chief contributions to the field of philosophy are his rejection of the idealism of his contemporaries and his embrace of a practical variety of materialism. He jettisons the traditional philosophic jargon for a brisk, compelling style that employs direct terms to express the metaphysics of the will.In The Wisdom of Life, an essay from Schopenhauer's final work, Parerga und Paralipomena (1851), the philosopher favors individual strength of will and independent, reasoned deliberation over the tendency to act on irrational impulses. He examines the ways in which life can be arranged to derive the highest degree of pleasure and success, presents guidelines to achieving this full and rich manner of living, and advises that even a life well lived must always aspire to grander heights. Abounding in subjects of enduring relevance, Schopenhauer's highly readable work appears here in an excellent translation.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,96,4.2,8525,409,The Wisdom of Life,Philosophy|Nonfiction|Writing|Essays|Classics|European Literature|German Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328864432l/21182.jpg,96,,,,,,,,,

Here, in the space of four years, she lost five young men dear to her, including her beloved brother-lost to drugs, accidents, murder, and suicide. Their deaths were seemingly unconnected, yet their lives had been connected, by identity and place, and as Jesmyn dealt with these losses, she came to a staggering truth: These young men died because of who they were and the place they were from, because certain disadvantages breed a certain kind of bad luck. Because they lived with a history of racism and economic struggle. The agonizing reality commanded Jesmyn to write, at last, their true stories and her own.Men We Reaped opens up a parallel universe, yet it points to problems whose roots are woven into the soil under all our feet.

Thirteen-year-old Brianna Walker is ecstatic. She's about to sneak off to meet her first real boyfriend—a boyfriend she met on Facebook. But Brianna is in for a horrifying surprise because her boyfriend doesn't exist. Instead, Brianna unwittingly becomes the captive of a ring of drug dealers- turned-human traffickers who prey on lonely girls from dysfunctional homes. But they’ve made a big mistake in targeting Brianna because she doesn’t meet either of those criteria. Brianna’s Uncle Dre, a man with his own criminal past, is determined to find the niece who is more like a daughter to him. Rather than sit back and rely on police to bring Brianna home, Dre scours the dark corners of Los Angeles looking for her. He is stunned to learn that the trafficking of children isn’t just happening in other countries. It’s occurring at epidemic levels right in his own backyard. Dre is not alone in his desperate search. Loretha Johnson knows this world well. A social worker who previously lived “the life,” Loretha now dedicates her time to saving as many young girls as she can find. She turns out to be an invaluable resource for Dre, who ultimately gets a lead on The Shepherd, a mastermind in the trafficking world whose every move is fueled by ego and greed. Dre vows to bring his reign of terror to an end. While Brianna makes a futile effort to thwart her captors, Dre is getting closer and closer to finding her. The woman he loves, attorney Angela Evans, knows the dangers faced by sexually exploited children because she represents them in juvenile court. Angela lends her moral support and, eventually, an important clue to Brianna’s whereabouts. As he races against the clock, Dre ultimately comes up with a daring plan—one that puts many lives in danger, including his own.

37042,Steven Pressfield,"In the time before Homer, the legendary Theseus, King of Athens (an actual historical figure), set sail on a journey that brought him into the land of tal Kyrte, the “free people,” a nation of proud female warriors whom the Greeks called “Amazons.” The Amazons, bound to each other as lovers as well as fighters, distrusted the Greeks, with their boastful talk of “civilization.” So when the great war queen Antiope fell in love with Theseus and fled with the Greeks, the mighty Amazon nation rose up in rage.Last of the Amazons is not merely a masterful tale of war and revenge. Pressfield has created a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters, from the unforgettable Selene, whose surrender to the Greeks does nothing to tame her; to her lover, Damon, an Athenian warrior who grows to cherish the wild Amazon ways; to the narrator, Bones, a young girl from a noble family who was nursed by Selene from birth and secretly taught the Amazon way; to the great Theseus, the tragic king; and to Antiope, the noble queen who betrayed tal Kyrte for the love of Theseus.With astounding immediacy and extraordinary attention to military detail, Pressfield transports readers into the heat and terror of war.

She's a successful reporter for a hi-tech magazine in Boston, making good money doing what she loves. When her researcher brings her iron-clad evidence of a money-laundering scheme, Miriam thinks she's found the story of the year. But when she takes it to her editor, she's fired on the spot and gets a death threat from the criminals she has uncovered.Before the day is over, she's received a locket left by the mother she never knew-the mother who was murdered when she was an infant. Within is a knotwork pattern, which has a hypnotic effect on her. Before she knows it, she's transported herself to a parallel Earth, a world where knights on horseback chase their prey with automatic weapons, and where world-skipping assassins lurk just on the other side of reality - a world where her true family runs things.The six families of the Clan rule the kingdom of Gruinmarkt from behind the scenes, a mixture of nobility and criminal conspirators whose power to walk between the worlds makes them rich in both. Braids of family loyalty and intermarriage provide a fragile guarantee of peace, but a recently-ended civil war has left the families shaken and suspicious.Taken in by her mother's people, she becomes the star of the story of the century-as Cinderella without a fairy godmother. As her mother's heir, Miriam is hailed as the prodigal countess Helge Thorold-Hjorth, and feted and feasted. Caught up in schemes and plots centuries in the making, Miriam is surrounded by unlikely allies, forbidden loves, lethal contraband, and, most dangerous of all, her family. Her unexpected return will supercede the claims of other clan members to her mother's fortune and power, and whoever killed her mother will be happy to see her dead, too.Behind all this lie deeper secrets still, which threaten everyone and everything she has ever known.

Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris.

She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow.

So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god. But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city.

14082,Michael   Lewis,"Four years after his #1 bestseller The Big Short, Michael Lewis returns to Wall Street to report on a high-tech predator stalking the equity markets.Flash Boys is about a small group of Wall Street guys who figure out that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for the benefit of insiders and that, post–financial crisis, the markets have become not more free but less, and more controlled by the big Wall Street banks. Working at different firms, they come to this realization separately; but after they discover one another, the flash boys band together and set out to reform the financial markets. This they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency trading—source of the most intractable problems—will have no advantage whatsoever.The characters in Flash Boys are fabulous, each completely different from what you think of when you think “Wall Street guy.” Several have walked away from jobs in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars a year. From their new vantage point they investigate the big banks, the world’s stock exchanges, and high-frequency trading firms as they have never been investigated, and expose the many strange new ways that Wall Street generates profits.The light that Lewis shines into the darkest corners of the financial world may not be good for your blood pressure, because if you have any contact with the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you. But in the end, Flash Boys is an uplifting read. Here are people who have somehow preserved a moral sense in an environment where you don’t get paid for that; they have perceived an institutionalized injustice and are willing to go to war to fix it.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,288,4.14,51713,3557,Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,Nonfiction|Business|Economics|Finance|Economics|History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404963230l/20604826.jpg,288,,,,,,,,,

29690,John D. Barrow,"This is a book about universes, a story that revolves around a single unusual and unappreciated fact: that Einstein's famous theory of relativity describes universes -- entire universes. Not many solutions of Einstein's tantalizing universe equations have ever been found, but those that have are all very remarkable. Some of them describe universes that expand in size, while others contract, some rotate like a top and others are chaotic. Some are perfectly smooth, while others are lumpy, or shaken in different directions by tides of energy; some oscillate forever, some become lifeless and cold, while others head towards a runaway future of ever-increasing expansion. Some permit time travel into the past, and others allow infinitely many things to happen in a finite amount of time. Only a few allow life to evolve within them; the rest remain unknowable to conscious minds. Some end with a bang, some with a whimper. Some don't end at all.Our story will encounter universes where the laws of physics can change from time to time and from one region to another, universes that have extra hidden dimensions of space and time, universes that are eternal, universes that live inside black holes, universes that end without warning, colliding universes, inflationary universes, and universes that come into being from something else -- or from nothing at all.Gradually, we will find ourselves introducing the latest and the best descriptions of the Universe we see around us today, together with the concept of the 'Multiverse' -- the universe of all possible universes -- that modern theories of physics lead us to contemplate. These are the most fantastic and far-reaching speculations in the whole of science.Other cosmology and astronomy books focus on particular topics -- dark matter, dark energy, the beginning of the universe, inflation, life-supporting coincidences, or the end of the universe -- but this book introduces the reader to whole universes in a coherent and unified way.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,368,3.86,195,22,The Book of Universes: Exploring the Limits of the Cosmos,Nonfiction|Science|Physics|Science|Astronomy|Science,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320481794l/10444674.jpg,368,,,,,,,,,

Master of the Senate takes Johnson’s story through one of its most remarkable periods: his twelve years, from 1949 through 1960, in the United States Senate. Once the most august and revered body in politics, by the time Johnson arrived the Senate had become a parody of itself and an obstacle that for decades had blocked desperately needed liberal legislation. Caro shows how Johnson’s brilliance, charm, and ruthlessness enabled him to become the youngest and most powerful Majority Leader in history and how he used his incomparable legislative genius--seducing both Northern liberals and Southern conservatives--to pass the first Civil Rights legislation since Reconstruction. Brilliantly weaving rich detail into a gripping narrative, Caro gives us both a galvanizing portrait of Johnson himself and a definitive and revelatory study of the workings of legislative power.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,1167,4.43,12949,660,Master of the Senate,Biography|History|Politics|Nonfiction|Politics|Presidents|North American Hi...|American History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388189118l/86525.jpg,1167,,,,,,,,,

With humor and levity, here Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century—one rooted in inclusion and awareness. She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics.

We follow them as their lives unfold together and apart; as they struggle to make a place for themselves in a world (not unlike our own) fueled by fear, lust, and greed; and as they discover the extraordinary depth—and frailty—of their connection. At once contemporary and timeless, Habibi gives us a love story of astounding resonance: a parable about our relationship to the natural world, the cultural divide between the first and third worlds, the common heritage of Christianity and Islam, and, most potently, the magic of storytelling.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,672,4.03,31951,3067,Habibi,Sequential Art|Graphic Novels|Sequential Art|Comics|Fiction|Graphic Novels Comics,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327899014l/10138607.jpg,672,,,,,,,,,

9051,Portia de Rossi,"""I didn't decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet, a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .""Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work—first as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying.In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn't enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point.Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder.From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women's health issues.In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies, Unbearable Lightness is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,320,3.84,35076,2504,Unbearable Lightness: A Story of Loss and Gain,Nonfiction|Biography|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography|Autobiography|Lgbt,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1292739170l/9219901.jpg,320,,,,,,,,,

31027,Friedrich Nietzsche,"Forward ""Incidentally, I despise everything which merely instructs me without increasing or immediately enlivening my activity."" These are Goethe's words. With them, as with a heartfelt expression of Ceterum censeo [I judge otherwise], our consideration of the worth and the worthlessness of history may begin. For this work is to set down why, in the spirit of Goethe's saying, we must seriously despise instruction without vitality, knowledge which enervates activity, and history as an expensive surplus of knowledge and a luxury, because we lack what is still most essential to us and because what is superfluous is hostile to what is essential. To be sure, we need history. But we need it in a manner different from the way in which the spoilt idler in the garden of knowledge uses it, no matter how elegantly he may look down on our coarse and graceless needs and distresses. That is, we need it for life and action, not for a comfortable turning away from life and action or merely for glossing over the egotistical life and the cowardly bad act. We wish to use history only insofar as it serves living. But there is a degree of doing history and a valuing of it through which life atrophies and degenerates. To bring this phenomenon to light as a remarkable symptom of our time is every bit as necessary as it may be painful. I have tried to describe a feeling which has often enough tormented me. I take my revenge on this feeling when I expose it to the general public. Perhaps with such a description someone or other will have reason to point out to me that he also knows this particular sensation but that I have not felt it with sufficient purity and naturalness and definitely have not expressed myself with the appropriate certainty and mature experience. Perhaps one or two will respond in this way. However, most people will tell me that this feeling is totally wrong, unnatural, abominable, and absolutely forbidden, that with it, in fact, I have shown myself unworthy of the powerful historical tendency of the times, as it has been, by common knowledge, observed for the past two generations, particularly among the Germans. Whatever the reaction, now that I dare to expose myself with this natural description of my feeling, common decency will be fostered rather than shamed, because I am providing many opportunities for a contemporary tendency like the reaction just mentioned to make polite pronouncements. Moreover, I obtain for myself something of even more value to me than respectability: I become publicly instructed and set straight about our times.  This essay is also out of touch with the times because here I am trying for once to see as a contemporary disgrace, infirmity, and defect something of which our age is justifiably proud, its historical culture. For I believe, in fact, that we are all suffering from a consumptive historical fever and at the very least should recognize that we are afflicted with it. If Goethe with good reason said that with our virtues we simultaneously cultivate our faults and if, as everyone knows, a hypertrophic virtue (as the historical sense of our age appears to me to be) can serve to destroy a people just as well as a hypertrophic vice, then people may make allowance for me this once. Also in my defence I should not conceal the fact that the experiences which aroused these feelings of torment in me I have derived for the most part from myself and only from others for the purpose of comparison and that, insofar as I am a student more of ancient times, particularly the Greeks, I come as a child in these present times to such anachronistic experiences concerning myself....",,Kindle Edition,,78,3.94,1438,75,On the Use and Abuse of History for Life,Philosophy|Nonfiction|History|European Literature|German Literature|Classics,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385450228l/18957343.jpg,78,,,,,,,,,

28171,Belsebuub|Lara Atwood,"The ancient veneration of the sun is one of the greatest celebrations in history. It has been encoded in sacred texts and sites by peoples separated by vast distances for thousands of years across the world.Although often looked at as simple-minded sun-worshipers, there is another reason why the ancients aligned some of their most inexplicable and advanced sites to the sun and stars, and encoded the movements of the heavens in their sacred teachings.The sun, source of all light and life, is central to a cosmic spirituality that is both ancient and timeless—and as ever-present as always. Its principles have formed the basis of many of the world’s religions—unbeknownst even to many of those who follow them—and are just as relevant to people searching for spirituality today.The Path of the Spiritual Sun by Belsebuub uncovers the profound spiritual significance of the veneration of the sun, pulling together the sites, texts, traditions, and symbols from around the world that were based on the solar cycle to reveal the common thread of spirituality running like a current of eternal knowledge through all of them and imbued in the very fabric of creation itself.Contains a guide with ceremonies and mantras to celebrate the solstices and equinoxes based on ancient practices from around the worldIn The Path of the Spiritual Sun, Belsebuub has created a comprehensive and practical guide to the celebration of the sun. Over seventeen chapters, the book explains:* Why ancient peoples all over the world and separated by vast distances, venerated the sun* How some of the most iconic religious and spiritual symbols can be found in the movements of the cosmos* The spiritual meaning behind the autumn, spring, winter, and summer solstices and equinoxes* A collation of the different esoteric practices and traditions that were celebrated on the solstice and equinox from around the world* An exploration of the many ancient sites that align to the solstice and equinox, and the esoteric symbols they contain* In-depth explanations of the meaning behind spiritual symbols, myths, sites, and sacred teachings from around the world* Ceremonies and rituals to celebrate the solstice and equinox today, based on actual ancient celebrations, including mantras, sacred texts, and symbols* A practical guide to revitalizing the traditions from around the world that celebrate the sun with a rediscovered understanding of their profound meaningAbout the AuthorBelsebuub is the author of a number of books on spirituality, out-of-body experiences, dreams, self-discovery, and esoteric knowledge.

Perez II,"People in the small town of Greenton mark their lives from that day in late summer when crowds lined the streets to see off high school athletic stars John Robison and John Mijias. That was the day the Johns, as they were known by adoring fans in Greenton, left for state college, and never made it there—or back. The Johns had spent their high school years putting that nowhere losing town on the map with playoff runs in football and state championship bids in baseball. For Concepcion ""Chon"" Gonzales, the days that the Johns headed out and didn't return was the first day of his new life. He had waited all his growing up years for a shot at Araceli when one of the Johns, John Mejia, stole her away. Now, while Greenton mourns, while the Johns' families become actors in a spectacle of grief, while Johns memorabilia is sold in every gas station and convenience store in town, while Araceli has to endure a senior year in the watchful gaze of the whole town, Chon Gonzales makes his slow methodical move on the only girl he's ever loved, hoping maybe that she won't notice what he wants.Rene S. Perez II was born in Kingsville, Texas, and raised in Corpus Christi. He received a BA from the University of Texas and an MFA from Texas State University. He is the winner of the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation Award and lives in Austin.

53152,Nate Silver,"Nate Silver built an innovative system for predicting baseball performance, predicted the 2008 election within a hair’s breadth, and became a national sensation as a blogger—all by the time he was thirty. The New York Times now publishes FiveThirtyEight.com, where Silver is one of the nation’s most influential political forecasters.Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good—or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary—and dangerous—science.Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver’s insights are an essential read.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,544,3.97,35467,2646,The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail - But Some Don't,Nonfiction|Science|Business|Economics|Politics|Psychology,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355058876l/13588394.jpg,544,,,,,,,,,

Turner continues Sarah's extraordinary story as she struggles to make a home in the Arizona Territory.It is winter 1906, and nearing bankruptcy after surviving drought, storms, and the rustling of her cattle, Sarah remains a stalwart pillar to her extended family. Then a stagecoach accident puts in her path three strangers who will change her life.In sickness and in health, neighbor Udell Hanna remains a trusted friend, pressing for Sarah to marry. When he reveals a plan to grant Sarah her dearest wish, she is overwhelmed with passion and excitement.

12434,Herbjørg Wassmo,"On the scale of Gone with the Wind and War and Peace, this grand, sweeping epic will enthrall readers just as Dina bewitches everyone she meets.Set in Norway in the mid-nineteenth century, Dina's Book presents an extraordinary heroine. Beautiful, eccentric, and tempestuous, Dina carries a terrible burden: at the age of five she accidentally causes her mother's death. Blamed by her father and banished to a farm, she grows up untamed and untaught. Nobody leads the child through her grief, and the accident remains a gruesome riddle of death. Her guilt becomes her obsession: her unforgiving mother haunts her every day.After several years of exile, and at the insistence of the local pastor, her father takes Dina back. By now she has become like a wolf cub. Her father has remarried, to a younger woman whom she detests, and a strict discipline begins. A tutor is brought in; coarse language is replaced by polite conversation, climbing to the top of the trees by music. But the efforts have little effect. Private and closely guarded, Dina nonetheless is able to manipulate those around her, while her unconventional behavior and erotic power both enchant and ensnare.At sixteen Dina is married off to wealthy fifty-year-old landowner Jacob, a friend of her father who has fallen completely under her spell. Jacob dies under mysterious circumstances, and Dina becomes mute. When finally she emerges from her trauma, she runs Jacob's estate with an iron hand. But still Dina wrestles with her two unappeased ghosts: Jacob and her mother. Until one day a mysterious stranger, the Russian wanderer Leo, enters her life and changes it forever.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,527,4.01,2360,112,Dina's Book,Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1459977507l/1691271.jpg,527,,,,,,,,,

17236,Meir Shalev|Elena Loewenthal,"Nevicò quel giorno, il 6 febbraio 1950, nella fertile valle di Iezreel, e Moshe Rabinovich si scagliò furiosamente con l'ascia contro un eucalipto secolare, un simbolo per tutti gli abitanti del villaggio, ma per lui soprattutto un mezzo attraverso cui si sarebbe attuato un tragico destino. Da questo episodio epocale per la memoria della piccola comunità, si diparte il lungo racconto di Zayde, il protagonista - ragazzino e poi uomo - che accompagna il lettore in un suggestivo viaggio sul filo dei ricordi. Al centro della storia è Yehudit, madre di Zayde, una donna forte e indipendente, custode di una sofferenza viscerale e di un lacerante segreto. Tre figure maschili si alternano sulla scena: sono gli uomini, diversissimi tra loro, che si contendono l'amore di Yehudit e la paternità di Zayde, occupandosene generosamente a modo proprio e secondo i propri mezzi. Mescolando voci ed episodi, passato e presente, Zayde ricrea una fitta trama di rapporti personali, di fatti che si intersecano per arrivare a ricostruire un mosaico esistenziale collettivo al cui centro campeggia il mistero di Yehudit, sfuggente e inarrivabile. Dominata dall'idea di un destino ineluttabile che grava su tutti ""smisurato e indifferente"", la narrazione procede secondo un ritmo pacato, scandito dai suoni, dai profumi - indimenticabili quelli delle prelibate cene che Yaakov, uno dei padri, prepara a Zayde - e dagli eventi di un microcosmo rurale che assurge a emblema universale.",,Paperback,9.79E+12,409,4.08,708,80,Per amore di una donna,Fiction|Cultural|Israel|Literature|Jewish|Historical|Historical Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1401817359l/12494271.jpg,409,,,,,,,,,

35459,Sheila Weller,"A groundbreaking and irresistible biography of three of America's most important musical artists -- Carole King, Joni Mitchell, and Carly Simon -- charts their lives as women at a magical moment in time. Carole King, Joni Mitchell, and Carly Simon remain among the most enduring and important women in popular music. Each woman is distinct. Carole King is the product of outer-borough, middle-class New York City; Joni Mitchell is a granddaughter of Canadian farmers; and Carly Simon is a child of the Manhattan intellectual upper crust. They collectively represent, in their lives and their songs, a great swath of American girls who came of age in the late 1960s. Their stories trace the arc of the now mythic sixties generation -- female version -- but in a bracingly specific and deeply recalled way, far from cliche. The history of the women of that generation has never been written -- until now, through their resonant lives and emblematic songs. Filled with the voices of many dozens of these women's intimates, who are speaking in these   for the first time, this alternating biography reads like a novel -- except it's all true, and the heroines are famous and beloved. Sheila Weller captures the character of each woman and gives a balanced portrayal enriched by a wealth of new information. Girls Like Us is an epic treatment of mid century women who dared to break tradition and become what none had been before them -- confessors in song, rock superstars, and adventurers of heart and soul.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,584,3.71,4694,821,"Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon - and the Journey of a Generation",Music|Nonfiction|Biography|Biography Memoir|Womens|History,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347561757l/2319322.jpg,584,,,,,,,,,

43582,Machado de Assis,"Publicado pela primeira vez em livro em 1891, depois portanto de Memórias póstumas de Brás Cubas (1881) e antes de Dom Casmurro (1899), Quincas Borba é uma das obras mais marcantes da fase realista de Machado de Assis. Talvez por se situar justamente entre esses dois monumentos da obra machadiana, o romance muitas vezes foi considerado uma realização menor, uma espécie de mera continuação das Memórias póstumas - para irritação de seu autor, que em um raro comentário sobre a própria ficção afirmou que a presença do personagem Quincas Borba era “o único vínculo” entre os dois livros.Mais do que ao marco inaugural do Realismo no Brasil, porém, Quincas Borba remete ao Machado contista que começava a abordar temas historicamente mais próximos de sua época e a explorar os conflitos psicológicos de seus personagens com sua sofisticada e irônica narrativa em terceira pessoa presente em contos clássicos como “A cartomante” e “A causa secreta”. Neste romance da maturidade do autor, a história do provinciano Rubião - herdeiro da fortuna do idiossincrático filósofo Quincas Borba - e dos tipos urbanos da corte que o levam à ruína é narrada com o distanciamento, o ceticismo e o senso de humor implacável de que só Machado de Assis era capaz.Esta edição de Quincas Borba, além de mais uma centena de notas explicativas, traz uma extensa e abrangente introdução do britânico John Gledson, estudioso da obra machadiana e tradutor de Dom Casmurro para o inglês.",,Paperback,,360,3.94,2729,76,Quincas Borba,Classics|Fiction|Cultural|Brazil|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412263423l/23298019.jpg,360,,,,,,,,,
30738,W.H. Auden|Gilberto Forti,"«I temi di queste poesie sono l’amore e la disonestà – i due poli tra i quali ci siamo trovati a soggiornare nel nostro secolo, pronti a gloriarci della loro occasionale divergenza ma bravissimi, anche quando siamo sfortunati, a conciliarli tra loro, a fonderli insieme. Ci sono buone ragioni se i versi del poeta oscillano tra la più intensa tenerezza e parossismi di indifferenza, e se da queste oscillazioni nasce uno stridente lirismo che non ha precedenti». Così scrive Brodskij presentando queste dieci poesie di W.H. Auden. Composte negli anni Trenta, e impregnate di un angoscioso «odore del futuro», esse parlano dell’amore nella varietà dei suoi stati, dall’esaltazione alla desolazione. Con un vago tono di ballata sul fondo, e quasi sfidando una musica a seguirli, questi versi hanno un «timbro tagliente» che incide le parole nella mente annientando ogni ostacolo.

1328,Susan Cain,"At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society.In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.",First Edition (U.S.),Hardcover,9.78E+12,333,4.05,250893,19757,Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,Nonfiction|Self Help|Psychology,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328562861l/8520610.jpg,333,,,,,,,,,

In August 2003, Jim Beaver, a character actor whom many know from the popular HBO series Deadwood, and his wife Cecily learned what they thought was the worst news possible- their daughter Maddie was autistic. Then six weeks later the roof fell in-Cecily was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer. Jim immediately began writing a nightly e-mail as a way to keep more than one hundred family and friends up to date about Cecily's condition. Soon four thousand people a day, from all around the world, were receiving them. Initially a cathartic exercise for Jim, the prose turned into an unforgettable journey for his readers. Cecily died four months after being diagnosed, but Jim continued the e-mails for a year after her diagnosis, revealing how he and Maddie coped with Cecily's death and how they managed to move forward. Life's That Way is a compilation of those nightly e-mails. Jim's experience is universal for anybody who has lost a loved one. But Life's That Way is not solely about loss. It is an immediate, day-by-day account of living through a nightmare but also of discovering the joy of a child, of being on the receiving end of unthinkable kindness, and of learning to navigate life anew. As Jim says, these are hard-won blessings.

During his more than forty years in the business, Williams has been one of the true innovators, winning three Academy Awards and serving as the link between Disney's golden age of animation by hand and the new computer animation exemplified by Toy Story.

In this book, based on his sold-out master classes in the United States and across Europe, Williams provides the underlying principles of animation that every animator--from beginner to expert, classic animator to computer animation whiz --needs.

24755,James Dodson,"Authorized, intimate, and definitive, Ben Hogan: A Life is the long-awaited biography of one of golf’s greatest, most enigmatic legends, narrated with the unique eloquence that has made author James Dodson a critically acclaimed national bestseller. One man is often credited with shaping the landscape of modern golf. Ben Hogan was a short, trim, impeccably dressed Texan whose fierce work ethic, legendary steel nerves, and astonishing triumph over personal disaster earned him not only an army of adoring fans, but one of the finest careers in the history of the sport. Hogan captured a record-tying four U.S. Opens, won five of six major tournaments in a single season, and inspired future generations of professional golfers from Palmer to Norman to Woods.Yet for all his brilliance, Ben Hogan was an enigma. He was an American hero whose personal life, inner motivation, and famed “secret” were the source of great public mystery. As Hogan grew into a giant on the pro tour, the combination of his cool outward demeanor and invincible, laser-guided accuracy on the golf course froze formidable opponents in their tracks. In 1949, at the peak of his career, Hogan’s mystique was reinforced by a catastrophic automobile accident in which he and his wife, Valerie, were nearly killed after being hit head-on by a Greyhound bus. Doctors predicted Hogan might never walk again – let alone set foot on another golf course. But his miraculous three-year recovery and comeback led to one of the greatest performances in golf history when in 1953 he won the Masters, the U.S. Open, and the British Open (something that’s never been repeated). In this first-ever family-authorized biography, renowned author James Dodson expertly and emotionally reconstructs Hogan’s complicated life. He discovers an intensely honest man handicapped by self-doubt, buoyed by the determination to prove his own abilities, and unable to escape a long-buried childhood tragedy – the core of the Hogan “secret.” Dodson also reveals both the legendary devotion and eventual strain in Hogan’s sixty-two-year marriage, and a Hogan rarely seen by the public: a warm, jovial man whose charitable spirit and sharp business sense enabled him to build the powerful golf equipment company bearing his name to this day. Ben Hogan: A Life is the authoritative inside portrait golf fans have long awaited.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,544,4.31,305,25,Ben Hogan: An American Life,Sports and Games|Sports|Biography|Nonfiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320546077l/337825.jpg,544,,,,,,,,,

39498,William Nicholson|Peter Sís,"'Slaves of the Mastery' is the fantastically vivid, breathtaking sequel to 'The Wind Singer' by William Nicholson.Written with the same passion and cinematic scope as the first book in the series, 'Slaves of the Mastery' picks up the story of siblings Kestrel and Bowman five years on from the closing chapter of 'The Wind Singer'. The city of Aramanth has become a kinder place, but in becoming kinder it has also become weaker, making it the perfect target for the ruthless soldiers of the Mastery. After a swift and brutal battle that leaves the city burned and the Manth people destined for slavery, Kestrel finds herself alone, angry and bitterly sworn to wreak her own revenge. But first she must find her beloved brother Bowman, and he in turn must find a way of understanding the secrets of the mysterious Singer people. Only then can the pair begin to strike out against the Mastery and begin a voyage that will bring the Manth people back to their former stature.'Slaves of the Mastery' lives up to all the promises made by 'The Wind Singer', and readers who enjoyed the first book will certainly be thrilled by the pace and execution of the second.

25452,Gary Taubes,"Challenging the Conventional Wisdom on Diet, Weight, and DiseaseIn this groundbreaking book, the result of seven years of research in every science connected with the impact of nutrition on health, award-winning science writer Gary Taubes shows us that almost everything we believe about the nature of a healthy diet is wrong.For decades we have been taught that fat is bad for us, carbohydrates better, and that the key to a healthy weight is eating less and exercising more. Yet with more and more people acting on this advice, we have seen unprecedented epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Taubes argues persuasively that the problem lies in refined carbohydrates (white flour, sugar, easily digested starches) and sugars–via their dramatic and longterm effects on insulin, the hormone that regulates fat accumulation–and that the key to good health is the kind of calories we take in, not the number. There are good calories, and bad ones.Good CaloriesThese are from foods without easily digestible carbohydrates and sugars. These foods can be eaten without restraint.Meat, fish, fowl, cheese, eggs, butter, and non-starchy vegetables. Bad CaloriesThese are from foods that stimulate excessive insulin secretion and so make us fat and increase our risk of chronic disease—all refined and easily digestible carbohydrates and sugars. The key is not how much vitamins and minerals they contain, but how quickly they are digested. (So apple juice or even green vegetable juices are not necessarily any healthier than soda.) Bread and other baked goods, potatoes, yams, rice, pasta, cereal grains, corn, sugar (sucrose and high fructose corn syrup), ice cream, candy, soft drinks, fruit juices, bananas and other tropical fruits, and beer. Taubes traces how the common assumption that carbohydrates are fattening was abandoned in the 1960s when fat and cholesterol were blamed for heart disease and then –wrongly–were seen as the causes of a host of other maladies, including cancer. He shows us how these unproven hypotheses were emphatically embraced by authorities in nutrition, public health, and clinical medicine, in spite of how well-conceived clinical trials have consistently refuted them. He also documents the dietary trials of carbohydrate-restriction, which consistently show that the fewer carbohydrates we consume, the leaner we will be. With precise references to the most significant existing clinical studies, he convinces us that there is no compelling scientific evidence demonstrating that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease, that salt causes high blood pressure, and that fiber is a necessary part of a healthy diet. Based on the evidence that does exist, he leads us to conclude that the only healthy way to lose weight and remain lean is to eat fewer carbohydrates or to change the type of the carbohydrates we do eat, and, for some of us, perhaps to eat virtually none at all.The 11 Critical Conclusions of Good Calories, Bad Calories: 1. Dietary fat, whether saturated or not, does not cause heart disease. 2. Carbohydrates do, because of their effect on the hormone insulin. The more easily-digestible and refined the carbohydrates and the more fructose they contain, the greater the effect on our health, weight, and well-being. 3. Sugars—sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup specifically—are particularly harmful. The glucose in these sugars raises insulin levels; the fructose they contain overloads the liver.4. Refined carbohydrates, starches, and sugars are also the most likely dietary causes of cancer, Alzheimer’s Disease, and the other common chronic diseases of modern times. 5. Obesity is a disorder of excess fat accumulation, not overeating and not sedentary behavior. 6. Consuming excess calories does not cause us to grow fatter any more than it causes a child to grow taller. 7. Exercise does not make us lose excess fat; it makes us hungry. 8. We get fat because of an imbalance—a disequilibrium—in the hormonal regulation of fat tissue and fat metabolism. More fat is stored in the fat tissue than is mobilized and used for fuel. We become leaner when the hormonal regulation of the fat tissue reverses this imbalance. 9. Insulin is the primary regulator of fat storage. When insulin levels are elevated, we stockpile calories as fat. When insulin levels fall, we release fat from our fat tissue and burn it for fuel. 10. By stimulating insulin secretion, carbohydrates make us fat and ultimately cause obesity. By driving fat accumulation, carbohydrates also increase hunger and decrease the amount of energy we expend in metabolism and physical activity.11. The fewer carbohydrates we eat, the leaner we will be. Good Calories, Bad Calories is a tour de force of scientific investigation–certain to redefine the ongoing debate about the foods we eat and their effects on our health.From the Hardcover edition.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,634,4.18,7987,738,"Good Calories, Bad Calories",Health|Nonfiction|Food and Drink|Food|Health|Nutrition|Science|Sports|Fitness,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348003139l/2442529.jpg,634,,,,,,,,,

29963,L.E. Modesitt Jr.,"Set in the same universe as The Parafaith War (but two centuries later, and intended to be read independently), The Ethos Factor is the story of Commander Van C. Albert of the Republic Space Force of Taran, a brave and resourceful officer who once defeated a larger enemy ship but indirectly caused the loss of a civilian liner in the process. Cleared by the board of inquiry, but an embarrassment to the high command, he retains his commission but is given only dead-end assignments. For a time, he must watch helplessly as cold war among economic, religious and political rivals evolves toward interstellar open warfare.Assigned as a military attaché at the Taran embassy on Scandya, Van is seriously wounded foiling an assassination. Decorated, promoted and summarily retired while still in a coma, he wakes to find himself honorably but intolerably unemployed. Then the harmless sounding Integrated Information Systems foundation of the Eco-Tech Coalition recruits him to fly a starship, Van finds he now has a powerful new vantage point not just for observation, but for action. The IIS has interests everywhere and Van is not just a pilot, but their point man in a conflict that will shake the worlds.Modesitt uses a distinctive blend of space battles, political and economic intrigue, and issues of race and religion to address deep questions of good and evil, ethics and self-interest.

42815,Daniel James Brown,"The New York Times–bestselling story about American Olympic triumph in Nazi Germany Out of the depths of the Depression comes an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times—the improbable, intimate account of how nine working-class boys from the American West showed the world at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin what true grit really meant. It was an unlikely quest from the start. With a team composed of the sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the University of Washington’s eight-oar crew team was never expected to defeat the elite teams of the East Coast and Great Britain, yet they did, going on to shock the world by defeating the German team rowing for Adolf Hitler. The emotional heart of the tale lies with Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not only to regain his shattered self-regard but also to find a real place for himself in the world. Drawing on the boys’ own journals and vivid memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, Brown has created an unforgettable portrait of an era, a celebration of a remarkable achievement, and a chronicle of one extraordinary young man’s personal quest.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,404,4.34,167242,18473,The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics,Nonfiction|History|Sports and Games|Sports|Biography|Historical,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405286839l/18667902.jpg,404,,,,,,,,,
16919,David Bellos,"Funny and surprising on every page, Is That a Fish in Your Ear? offers readers new insight into the mystery of how we come to know what someone else means—whether we wish to understand Astérix cartoons or a foreign head of state. Using translation as his lens, David Bellos shows how much we can learn about ourselves by exploring the ways we use translation, from the historical roots of written language to the stylistic choices of Ingmar Bergman, from the United Nations General Assembly to the significance of James Cameron's Avatar.Is That a Fish in Your Ear? ranges across human experience to describe why translation sits deep within us all, and why we need it in so many situations, from the spread of religion to our appreciation of literature; indeed, Bellos claims that all writers are by definition translators. Written with joie de vivre, reveling both in misunderstanding and communication, littered with wonderful asides, it promises any reader new eyes through which to understand the world. In the words of Bellos: ""The practice of translation rests on two presuppositions. The first is that we are all different: we speak different tongues, and see the world in ways that are deeply influenced by the particular features of the tongue that we speak. The second is that we are all the same—that we can share the same broad and narrow kinds of feelings, information, understandings, and so forth. Without both of these suppositions, translation could not exist. Nor could anything we would like to call social life. Translation is another name for the human condition.""",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,390,3.77,1937,289,Is That a Fish in Your Ear?

Working under the government’s shroud of secrecy, CIA operative Dew Phillips crisscrosses the country trying in vain to capture a live victim. With only decomposing corpses for clues, CDC epidemiologist Margaret Montoya races to analyze the science behind this deadly contagion. She discovers that these killers all have one thing in common – they’ve been contaminated by a bioengineered parasite, shaped by a complexity far beyond the limits of known science.Meanwhile Perry Dawsey – a hulking former football star now resigned to life as a cubicle-bound desk jockey – awakens one morning to find several mysterious welts growing on his body. Soon Perry finds himself acting and thinking strangely, hearing voices . . . he is infected. The fate of the human race may well depend on the bloody war Perry must wage with his own body, because the parasites want something from him, something that goes beyond mere murder. Infected is the first major print release from Internet phenom Scott Sigler, whose podcast-only audiobooks have drawn an immense cult following, with more than three million individual episodes downloaded.

9030,J.J. Connolly,"Our narrator’s too smart to tell you his name (“if I [did], you’d be as clever as me”), but he’s not afraid to tell you everything else about the “layer cake”—London’s intricately arranged constellation of underworld fiefdoms. The worst thing about drug dealing—according to our unnamed narrator—whether you're a classy top dealer trading millions or a down-and-out street pusher, is that you have to relate to a lot of total idiots - loudmouths and tough-guy wannabes who aren't afraid to ""get nicked by old bill and thrown in the boob"" (arrested by police and jailed). Our narrator is a smoothly diplomatic 29-year-old cocaine dealer who has earned a respected place among England's Mafia elite. Speaking in a language rich with drug jargon, vulgarities, British slang, and Cockneyisms, he manages high-level trafficking with a tough old veteran partner, Mister Mortimer, a man who gave the narrator his start in the business, and who has seen his share of prison (five and a half year term) and deadly fights (he owns a porn store, and loves to set up guys looking for child porn by directing them to come back at a special time, then beating the living daylights out of them when they return). Our narrator’s goal is to retire at 30 and spend his remaining years far from the danger and double-dealing of London's crime gangs. But like most high rollers, he finds it hard to walk away from ""just one more"" deal.Morty rings up our narrator one early Saturday morning with an invitation to an exclusive members only restaurant far off in the English countryside. They’re off for “a spot of luncheon” with the Don, Jimmy Price. Jimmy is a legend, a crime boss who’s been in the business for years by hiring the best lawyers and keeping a low-key profile. This is a man who is always gets what he wants, and is not used to people refusing him favors. Which is exactly the spot our narrator soon finds himself in when over lunch, Jimmy hands down a tough assignment: find Charlotte Ryder, the missing rich princess daughter of Jimmy's old pal Edward, a powerful construction business player and gossip papers socialite. It’s a hard deal to refuse, but Jimmy can spot the edge on our narrator and makes him a deal – if you find Charlotte, you can leave the life for good.Our narrator sets out to find Billy Bogus, a grifter with a gift for mimicry and ingratiating himself into any area of society he wants. Bank and credit card fraud is his trade, with a healthy dollop of hustling young women out of their trust funds for good measure. On his way to meet Bogus, he runs into a small time punk named Sid in a local nightclub who runs with a band of thugs called “the Yahoos.” With him is a stunning woman, a “real love-a-player type” named Tammy. Sid tells our narrator a bloody story about a friend of his named “The Duke” who recently got ambushed by a state of the art crew armed with laser sighted Uzis. Our narrator won’t figure out the significance of this story until later as he’s too busy checking out Tammy, who flirtatiously gives him her number while Sid is distracted.Our narrator reports to Jimmy’s right hand man, Gene, that he’s on the case, but Gene has other business. Turns out that the Yahoos have two million pounds' worth of Grade A ecstasy to sell, and Gene wants our narrator to handle the deal. It’s an irresistible deal, just the right amount of money to top off his retirement fund. He sets up a meeting with him, Mort, and the Yahoos kingpins, Big Frankie and JD while finally catching up with Billy Bogus, who agrees to help find our narrator Charlotte by tracking down Charlotte’s boyfriend Kinky—for a price, of course.Big Frankie and JD keep quiet about where they’ve gotten the tablets, but the “gear” is top quality, confirmed by none other than Sir Alex (“chief chemical taster”). Things are looking up when Mort sets up his gang to meet up with a crew, headed by a man named Trevor, up in Northern England who he thinks will be perfect to unload the goods on. There’s only one problem – they don’t want the goods. This crew informs our narrator that an Ecstasy factory has been hijacked—most likely by the Yahoos—and now a brutal neo-Nazi sect wants those pills back. They’ve already hit up a house that belongs to “the Duke”, and here is where Sid’s story from the club all makes sense.Our narrator drives back to London with Mort in tow and gets a call from Bogus, who tells him he’s found Kinky. Dead. In a London housing project. It looks like a typical drug overdose, but a young kid drug dealer who helped Bogus find Kinky says he was murdered.Meanwhile, our narrator sets up a rendezvous with Tammy in a hotel room. As he steps out of the shower, two toughs ambush him, who roll him up in a carpet, and abduct him in a long box. The toughs take him to a construction site to meet with their boss, Eddie Ryder, Charlotte’s father. Eddie tells our narrator that Jimmy Price has pulled a fast one on him – his daughter’s isn’t missinnnnnng. What’s worse, Jimmy’s made a deal with some renegade Chechens that have swindled him to the tune of thirteen million pounds. To pull himself out of the hole, he set up the narrator to find Eddie’s daughter, then hold her for ransom. The double cross, though, turns into a triple cross when Eddie plays our narrator a tape that reveals Jimmy Price is an informer for the police and has set up a sting for our narrator where he plans to send him to jail for long time, and make off with the narrator’s retirement fund.Finding himself undercut, double-crossed, hung out to dry, and struggling to survive, our narrator’s survival instincts kick in. He changes from a turn-the-other-cheek diplomat to a revenge-charged hit man overnight, starting by killing Jimmy Price. Next, he agrees to sell the ecstasy tablets to Ryder, who plans to unload them to the Yakuza in Japan, which will put a nice chunk of change in our narrator’s pocket. Just before he leaves, our narrator mentions a bit of dirt that Jimmy gave him in passing about Eddie, insuring that Eddie won’t kill our narrator—just in case he gets any funny ideas about doing so.Suddenly, all of the narrator’s problems looked solved. Jimmy’s dead, and those two million tabs of ecstasy are headed to Japan. Then, Jimmy’s right hand man Gene asks for a meeting with Mort and our narrator. Gene accuses our narrator of killing Jimmy and threatens to kill him unless he confesses. Our narrator plays the tape Ryder gave him for Gene and Morty, revealing Jimmy’s double-dealings with the police. Gene lets our narrator go and agrees never to discuss the crime again.All that remains is the little matter of two million tabs of ecstasy. In a flourish of double and triple crosses, our narrator’s deal to exchange the tabs for cash at Heathrow Airport falls apart, but ends up with the tabs in Amsterdam. As he prepares to dash off to Amsterdam to collect the loot, he decides to give Tammy a call before he leaves. Unfortunately, Tammy’s jealous boyfriend Sidney tailed her, and shot the narrator three times, including twice in the head. The narrator lived, recovered in the hospital, and is ordered into retirement and exile by the cops. He rings Tammy to offer her one more chance to meet, but she tells him “girls like dangerous guys but you’re seriously fuckin’ life threatening. How many girls do you know end up covered in blood, chief prosecution witness in an attempted murder trial on their first date?” She wishes our narrator well, who has plenty of time to reflect on his life as an ex-pat in Curacao, Brazil. He acknowledges that, in life, you never stop learning, but you never stop forgetting either. He has plenty of time now to ruminate on both, living a life where he can remember why he left the business, but never forget why he can’t tell us his name.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,344,3.99,1288,92,Layer Cake,Fiction|Mystery|Crime|Thriller|Mystery|European Literature|British Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442637049l/29421.jpg,344,,,,,,,,,

After a dozen doctors and thousands in medical bills, I was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder--one that causes me to lose track of time. Sometimes it’s hours, days or even weeks with no recollection of anything. The good thing is it's been almost two years since I had my last ‘black out’. It sounds much better than what the doctors refer to them as, 'episodes', like my life is a freakin' comedy. During those two years of normal, I finally managed to get my Bachelor’s degree, a job I love, and I’ve just proposed to a woman who has been there for me through it all. For the first time in a long time everything is on track.Until a strange woman shows up at my door—she says I'm her husband and I think she’s crazy. Until, I get a voice mail on my phone. It’s from a guy name Cal. The weird part is, it’s the same name the strange woman called me.

A cold case reopened -- and solved -- with dogged police work and new evidence. One of the shocking true crimes of passion and greed from Ann Rule's Crime Files.Former Marine sergeant and judo instructor Roland Pitre Jr. claimed it was all an elaborate plan to win back his wife's love -- it wasn't supposed to end with her dead body in the trunk of a car. Nearly twenty years later, he acknowledged that he had hired someone to kill his estranged wife in 1988, though his alleged excuse for why a monstrous ""mistake"" happened is as shocking and convoluted as the crime itself. Eventually, he was charged with first-degree murder in the long-unsolved death of Cheryl Pitre, after a mysterious witness betrayed Pitre to save his own skin.

Then, in a dramatic change, described by scientists as 'the greatest riddle in human history', all the skills & qualities that we value most highly in ourselves appeared already fully formed, as tho bestowed on us by hidden powers. In Supernatural Hancock sets out to investigate this mysterious before-&-after moment & to discover the truth about the influences that gave birth to the modern mind. His quest takes him on a detective journey from the beautiful painted caves of prehistoric France, Spain & Italy to rock shelters in the mountains of S. Africa, where he finds extraordinary Stone Age art. He uncovers clues that lead him to the Amazon rainforest to drink the hallucinogen Ayahuasca with shamans, whose paintings contain images of 'super-natural beings' identical to the animal-human hybrids depicted in prehistoric caves. Hallucinogens such as mescaline also produce visionary encounters with exactly the same beings. Scientists at the cutting edge of consciousness research have begun to consider the possibility that such hallucinations may be real perceptions of other dimensions. Could the supernaturals 1st depicted in the painted caves be the ancient teachers of humankind? Could it be that human evolution isn't just the meaningless process Darwin identified, but something more purposive & intelligent that we've barely begun to understand?AcknowledgementsPart 1: Visions 1: Plant that enables men to see the dead 2: Greatest riddle of archeology 3: Vine of souls Part 2: Caves 4: Therianthropy5: Riddles of the caves6: Shabby academy 7: Searching for a Rosetta Stone8: Code in the mind 9: Serpents of the Drakensberg10: Wounded healer Part 3: Beings 11: Voyage into the supernatural 12: Shamans in the sky 13: Spirit love 14: Secret commonwealth15: Here is a thing that will carry me away16: Dancers between worlds Part 4: Codes 17: Turning in to channel DMT18: Amongst the machine elves19: Ancient teachers in our DNA?20: Hurricane in the junkyard Part 5: Religions 21: Hidden Shamans22: Flesh of the GodsPart 6: Mysteries 23: Doors leading to another world Appendices Critics & criticisms of David Lewis-Williams' Neuropsychological theory of rock & cave artPsilocybe semilanceata-a hallucinogenic mushroom native to Europe / Roy Watlng Interview with Rick StrassmanReferences Index",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,710,4.22,2032,130,Supernatural: Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind,Nonfiction|History|Spirituality|Science,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390171021l/53324.jpg,710,,,,,,,,,

40660,Ben Macintyre,"In his celebrated bestsellers Agent Zigzag and Operation Mincemeat, Ben Macintyre told the dazzling true stories of a remarkable WWII double agent and of how the Allies employed a corpse to fool the Nazis and assure a decisive victory.  In Double Cross, Macintyre returns with the untold story of the grand final deception of the war and of the extraordinary spies who achieved it.   On June 6, 1944, 150,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy and suffered an astonishingly low rate of casualties.  D-Day was a stunning military accomplishment, but it was also a masterpiece of trickery. Operation Fortitude, which protected and enabled the invasion, and the Double Cross system, which specialized in turning German spies into double agents, deceived the Nazis into believing that the Allies would attack at Calais and Norway rather than Normandy. It was the most sophisticated and successful deception operation ever carried out, ensuring that Hitler kept an entire army awaiting a fake invasion, saving thousands of lives, and securing an Allied victory at the most critical juncture in the war.   The story of D-Day has been told from the point of view of the soldiers who fought in it, the tacticians who planned it, and the generals who led it. But this epic event in world history has never before been told from the perspectives of the key individuals in the Double Cross System. These include its director (a brilliant, urbane intelligence officer), a colorful assortment of MI5 handlers (as well as their counterparts in Nazi intelligence), and the five spies who formed Double Cross’s nucleus: a dashing  Serbian playboy, a Polish fighter-pilot, a bisexual Peruvian party girl, a deeply eccentric Spaniard with a diploma in chicken farming and a volatile Frenchwoman, whose obsessive love for her pet dog very nearly wrecked the entire plan. The D-Day spies were, without question, one of the oddest military units ever assembled, and their success depended on the delicate, dubious relationship between spy and spymaster, both German and British. Their enterprise was saved from catastrophe by a shadowy sixth spy whose heroic sacrifice is revealed here for the first time.   With the same depth of research, eye for the absurd and masterful storytelling that have made Ben Macintyre an international bestseller,  Double Cross is a captivating narrative of the spies who wove a web so intricate it ensnared Hitler’s army and carried thousands of D-Day troops across the Channel in safety.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,399,3.9,7444,822,Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies,History|Nonfiction|War|World War II|Spy Thriller|Espionage|War,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344370635l/13154628.jpg,399,,,,,,,,,

Efter rådføring med hans slægtsbog, Den Sorte Bog, finder han frem til, at han skal have fat på et specielt træ til brædderne. Det eneste nulevnede eksemplar findes på Mallorca, men det er ikke et sted, monstrene fra Neanderslottet kender til, så de beslutter sig for at kontakte Freddy. Desværre er Freddy på vej på solferie med forældrene, uvidende om den desperate situation hans venner står i. Bedst som hans mor pakker hans sager, dukker gruppen af væsner op for at snakke med Freddy.

45216,Philip K. Dick,"In Counter-Clock World, one of the most theologically probing of all of Dick’s books, the world has entered the Hobart Phase–a vast sidereal process in which time moves in reverse. As a result, libraries are busy eradicating books, copulation signifies the end of pregnancy, people greet with, “Good-bye,” and part with, “Hello,” and underneath the world’s tombstones, the dead are coming back to life. One imminent old-born is Anarch Peak, a vibrant religious leader whose followers continued to flourish long after his death. His return from the dead has such awesome implications that those who apprehend him will very likely be those who control the fate of the world. Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino. With breathtaking insight, he utilizes vividly unfamiliar worlds to evoke the hauntingly and hilariously familiar in our society and ourselves.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,218,3.55,3524,247,Counter-Clock World,Science Fiction|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355312681l/156723.jpg,218,,,,,,,,,

21636,V.E. Campudoni," LONGING is Book 2 of this Dangerously Arousing BDSM Erotic Romance Series. The DOM of all DOMs! Enzio’s longing for Lana is an endless, aching need. She is his drug. But Lana wants Enzio as her loving Master, and Dom 241 as the masked brute of a man who takes her roughly and shows her no mercy as he exhausts her sexually. She craves the beast with the bullwhip, and willingly accepts complimentary tickets to The Looking Glass. As the night’s captive at a party at The Looking Glass, Lana is blindfolded by Dom 241 and escorted to the center of a bed, where he ties her arms and legs to the four posts with a nylon rope. “I think you deserve a reward,” he says as he unbuttons his pants and moves between her legs. The muscular Dom with the sculpted body looms over her, ready to reward her as only he can. While Lana struggles between two Doms, Enzio confronts old demons, and enemies begin to surface. A dangerous, obsessed client stalks him, and a competitor’s club threatens his multi-million dollar business. Excerpt: Lana stared at his tight abs and chest before moving up to his masked face. She gazed into his strong eyes and he reached into his back pocket and pulled out a collar. “As of this moment, I am your Master,” he spoke sternly into her ear, “You will obey all of my orders and refer to me as Dom. Do you understand?” There was a slight hesitation before she nodded. He pulled the leash and Lana stumbled toward him. “Welcome to the Gala experience,” he growled. “Why are you here, Darling?” he asked. Lana didn’t know what to say as she watched him walk toward the door in the private room and click the lock. He turned to look at her and she felt a chill through her veins. “I won’t ask you again,” he growled. She tried to say something, but nothing came out. She felt his hands on her waist and he ran his fingers over her butt. Lana was shaking, and he pulled her hair. “I asked you a question, Darling,” his voice boomed. “I…I was curious,” she stuttered. “About what?” “I was curious about you, Master.” “I am not you Master!” he yelled. “You are already claimed. Call me Dom.” She hesitated briefly. “Yes, Dom.” “Does your Master satisfy you?” “Yes, Dom.” “Is your Master a good Master?” “Oh yes, Dom, he’s wonderful.” Her words caused him to smile. “Then I will ask you one last time, Darling, why are you here?” She didn’t answer. “What is it that you want from me that your Master cannot give to you, Lana?” Still she didn’t answer. “You have no safe word today,” he softly said, placing a blindfold over her eyes.

Small annoyances for which Chris MacNeil, Regan's actress mother, easily found explanations. The changes in eleven-year-old Regan were so gradual, too, that Chris did not recognise for some time how much her daughter's behaviour had altered. Even when she did, the medical tests which followed shed no light on Regan's symptoms, which grew more severe and frightening. It was almost as if a different personality had invaded the child. Desperate, Chris turned from the doctors to Father Damien Karras, a Jesuit priest who was trained as a psychiatrist and had a deep knowledge of such phenomena as satanism and possession. Was it possible that a demonic force was at large?

The howl tore across glaciers, over mountains and deep into the ice. Everyone says so. Except for my father; all he heard was Mother's sobs. Not of pain, but of joy, so he says.

Again, some would have me believe the fracture took place as I entered the world. But all that really matters, according to my parents, is that I, Solomon Ull Vincent, the first child born on Antarctica—the first and only Antarctican—was born on September 2nd, 1974.If only someone could have warned me that upon my return to the continent of my birth, thirteen years later, I would be kidnapped, subjected to tortures beyond comprehension and forced to fight…and kill. If only someone had hinted that I'd wind up struggling to survive in a subterranean world full of ancient warriors, strange creatures and supernatural powers.Had I been warned, I might have lived a normal life.

Still, their daring efforts yield an unexpected prize: a unique holotransceiver that bears intelligence capable of leading the Republic forces to their ultimate quarry, the ever-elusive Darth Sidious.Swiftly taking up the chase, Anakin and Obi-Wan follow clues from the droid factories of Charros IV to the far-flung worlds of the Outer Rim . . . every step bringing them closer to pinpointing the location of the Sith Lord-whom they suspect has been manipulating every aspect of the Separatist rebellion. Yet somehow, in the escalating galaxy-wide chess game of strikes, counterstrikes, ambushes, sabotage, and retaliations, Sidious stays constantly one move ahead.Then the trail takes a shocking turn. For Sidious and his minions have set in motion a ruthlessly orchestrated campaign to divide and overwhelm the Jedi forces-and bring the Republic to its knees.From the Hardcover edition.",Star Wars - Legends - Reprint,Mass Market Paperback,9.78E+12,370,3.84,5783,229,Labyrinth of Evil,Media Tie In|Star Wars|Science Fiction|Fiction|Fantasy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420792446l/14978.jpg,370,,,,,,,,,

15974,Dyan deNapoli,"ON JUNE 23, 2000, the iron-ore carrier MV Treasure, en route from Brazil to China, foundered off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa, spilling 1,300 tons of oil into the ocean and contaminating the habitat of 75,000 penguins. Realizing thJuneat 41 percent of the world’s population of African penguins could perish, local conservation officials immediately launched a massive rescue operation, and 12,500 volunteers from around the globe rushed to South Africa in hopes of saving the imperiled birds.Serving as a rehabilitation manager during the initial phase of the three-month rescue effort, Dyan deNapoli—better known as ""the Penguin Lady"" for her extensive work with penguins—and fellow volunteers de-oiled, nursed back to health, and released into the wild nearly all of the affected birds. Now, at the tenth anniversary of the disaster, deNapoli recounts this extraordinary true story of the world’s largest and most successful wildlife rescue. When she first entered the enormous warehouse housing most of the 19,000 oiled penguins, the birds’ total silence told deNapoli all she needed to know about the extent of their trauma. African penguins are very vocal by nature, prone to extended fits of raucous, competitive braying during territorial displays and pair-bonding rituals, but these poor creatures now stood silently, shoulder to shoulder, in a state of shock. DeNapoli vividly details the harrowing rescue process and the heartbreaking scenarios she came up against alongside thousands of volunteers: unforgettable images of them laboriously scrubbing the oil from every penguin feather and force-feeding each individually; the excruciatingly painful penguin bites every volunteer received; and the wrenching decisions about birds too ill to survive. She draws readers headfirst into the exhausting physical and emotional experience and brings to life the cast of remarkable characters—from Big Mike, a compassionate Jiu-Jitsu champion with a booming voice, who worked every day of the rescue effort; to a man named Welcome, aka ""the Penguin Whisperer,"" who had the amazing ability to calm any penguin he held in his arms; to Louis, a seventeen-year-old medical student who created a new formula for the highly effective degreaser used by the rescue mission—whose historic and heroic efforts saved the birds from near extinction. The extraordinary international collaboration of scientists, zookeepers, animal rescue groups, and thousands of concerned individuals helped save the African penguins—recently declared an endangered species—from an all-too-common man-made disaster.DeNapoli’s heartwarming and riveting story is not just a portrait of these captivating birds, nor is it merely a cautionary tale about the environment. It is also an inspirational chronicle of how following one’s passion can lead to unexpected, rewarding adventures—and illustrates not only how people from around the world can unite for a greater purpose, but how they can be extraordinarily successful when doing so.

O que impulsiona os personagens é a seca, áspera e cruel, e paradoxalmente a ligação telúrica, afetiva, que expõe naqueles seres em retirada, à procura de meios de sobrevivência e um futuro. Apesar desse sentimento de transbordante solidariedade e compaixão com que a narrativa acompanha a miúda saga do vaqueiro Fabiano e sua gente, o autor contou: Procurei auscultar a alma do ser rude e quase primitivo que mora na zona mais recuada do sertão... os meus personagens são quase selvagens... pesquisa que os escritores regionalistas não fazem e nem mesmo podem fazer ...porque comumente não são familiares com o ambiente que descrevem...Fiz o livrinho sem paisagens, sem diálogos. E sem amor. A minha gente, quase muda, vive numa casa velha de fazenda. As pessoas adultas, preocupadas com o estômago, não tem tempo de abraçar-se. Até a cachorra [Baleia] é uma criatura decente, porque na vizinhança não existem galãs caninos.Vidas secas é o livro em que Graciliano, visto como antipoético e anti-sonhador por excelência, consegue atingir, com o rigor do texto que tanto prezava, um estado maior de poesia.",,Paperback,9.79E+12,176,4.06,7153,157,Vidas Secas,Classics|Fiction|Cultural|Brazil,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1376282041l/334227.jpg,176,,,,,,,,,

51297,Pat Barker,"

The Regeneration Trilogy is Pat Barker's sweeping masterpiece of British historical fiction. 







1917, Scotland. At Craiglockhart War Hospital in Scotland, army psychiatrist William Rivers treats shell-shocked soldiers before sending them back to the front. In his care are poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, and Billy Prior, who is only able to communicate by means of pencil and paper. . .

Regeneration, The Eye in the Door and The Ghost Road follow the stories of these men until the last months of the war. Widely acclaimed and admired, Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy paints with moving detail the far-reaching consequences of a conflict which decimated a generation.

16134,Yves Marechal,"The Hydrogen Bond and the Water Molecule offers a synthesis of what is known and currently being researched on the topic of hydrogen bonds and water molecules. The most simple water molecular, H2O, is a fascinating but poorly understood molecule. Its unique ability to attract an exceptionally large number of hydrogen bonds induces the formation of a dense ""hydrogen bond network"" that has the potential to modify the properties of the surrounding molecules and their reactivities. The crucial role that water molecules play is described in this book. The author begins by providing an overview of the thermodynamical and structural properties of H-bonds before examining their much less known dynamical properties, which makes them appear as centres of reactivity. Methods used to observe these components are also reviewed. In the second part of the book the role played by the dense H-bond network developed by H2O molecules is examined. First in ice, where it has important atmospheric consequences, then in liquid water, and finally in macromolecules where it sheds some original light on the fundamental question ""How is it that without water and hydrogen bonds life would not exist?."" This book will be of interest to researchers in the fields of physics, chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology. It can also serve as a teaching aid for students attending course in chemical physics, chemistry or molecular biology. Engineers involved the water industry would benefit from reading this book, as would scientists working in pharmaceutics, cosmetics and materials.* overview of what is known and being researched on the topic of hydrogen bonds and water molecules* reviews methods used to observe interactions between water molecules and hydrogen bonds* examines role of H-bond network developed by H2O molecules",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,318,0,0,0,"The Hydrogen Bond and the Water Molecule: The Physics and Chemistry of Water, Aqueous and Bio Media",,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349039548l/6359195.jpg,318,,,,,,,,,

6389,Sharon Kay Penman,"The long-awaited and highly anticipated final volume in Penman’s trilogy of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine—a tumultuous conclusion to this timeless story of love, power, ambition, and betrayal. Where the second novel in the trilogy, Time And Chance, dealt with the extraordinary politics of the twelfth century, climaxing with the murder of Thomas Becket and Henry’s confrontation with the Church and self-imposed exile to Ireland, Devil’s Brood centers on the implosion of a family. And because it is a royal family whose domains span the English Channel and whose alliances encompass the Christian world, that collapse will have dire consequences. This is a story of betrayal as Henry’s three eldest sons and his wife enter into a rebellion against him, aligning themselves with his bitterest enemy, King Louis of France. But it is also the story of a great king whose brilliance forged an empire but whose personal blind spots led him into the most serious mistake of his life. Sharon Kay Penman has created a novel of tremendous power, as two strong-willed, passionate people clash, a family divides, and a marriage ends in all but name. Curiously, it is a novel without villains—only flawed human beings caught up in misperceptions and bad judgment calls. Most devastating to Henry was not his sons’ rebellion but his wife’s betrayal in joining them. How could it happen that two people whose love for each other was all consuming end up as bitter adversaries?

Now in this brilliant companion volume, Diamond probes the other side of the equation: What caused some of the great civilizations of the past to collapse into ruin, and what can we learn from their fates?As in Guns, Germs, and Steel, Diamond weaves an all-encompassing global thesis through a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives. Moving from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland, Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of catastrophe.

Mit Die Wasserweber schließt er eine weitere Trilogie ab, die mit Die Wellenläufer begann und mit Die Muschelmagier fortgesetzt wurde.

7651,Wes  Moore|Tavis Smiley,"Two kids with the same name lived in the same decaying city. One went on to be a Rhodes Scholar, decorated combat veteran, White House Fellow, and business leader. The other is serving a life sentence in prison. Here is the story of two boys and the journey of a generation. In December 2000, the Baltimore Sun ran a small piece about Wes Moore, a local student who had just received a Rhodes Scholarship. The same paper also ran a series of articles about four young men who had allegedly killed a police officer in a spectacularly botched armed robbery. The police were still hunting for two of the suspects who had gone on the lam, a pair of brothers. One was named Wes Moore.  Wes just couldn’t shake off the unsettling coincidence, or the inkling that the two shared much more than space in the same newspaper. After following the story of the robbery, the manhunt, and the trial to its conclusion, he wrote a letter to the other Wes, now a convicted murderer serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. His letter tentatively asked the questions that had been haunting him: Who are you? How did this happen?That letter led to a correspondence and relationship that have lasted for several years. Over dozens of letters and prison visits, Wes discovered that the other Wes had had a life not unlike his own: Both had grown up in similar neighborhoods and had had difficult childhoods, both were fatherless; they’d hung out on similar corners with similar crews, and both had run into trouble with the police. At each stage of their young lives they had come across similar moments of decision, yet their choices would lead them to astonishingly different destinies.Told in alternating dramatic narratives that take readers from heart-wrenching losses to moments of surprising redemption, The Other Wes Moore tells the story of a generation of boys trying to find their way in a hostile world.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,233,3.8,27891,3637,"The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates",Nonfiction|Biography|Autobiography|Memoir|Academic|School,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320554118l/7099273.jpg,233,,,,,,,,,

15556,E.T.A. Hoffmann|Anthea Bell|Jeremy Adler,"It was E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776-1822) who first explored many of the themes and techniques which were later used by writers from Dickens to Dostoyevsky, Poe to Kafka, Baudelaire to Marquez. His career reached a glorious climax in The Tomcat Murr, perhaps the strangest novel of the nineteenth century.. ""Hoffmann was a follower of Cervantes and Sterne, a pioneering 'magic realist', fascinated by Gothic horror, extreme mental states and supernatural events occurring within sharply (and sometimes satirically) rendered social settings. A talented composer and painter, he portrayed himself in the guise of Johannes Kreisler - the hypochondriac, antisocial and moody but brilliant musician. In this astonishing book, a vain and very bourgeois tomcat sets out to write his memoirs, using a biography of Kreisler as a blotting pad. By a printer's error, the two lives get spliced together into a bizarre double narrative.

46938,Eduardo Porter," Everything has a price, but it isn't always obvious what that price is.   Many of the prices we pay seem to make little sense. We shell out $2.29 for a coffee at Starbucks when a nearly identical brew can be had at the corner deli for less than a dollar. We may be less willing to give blood for $25 than to donate it for free. Americans hire cheap illegal immigrants to fix the roof or mow the lawn, and vote for politicians who promise to spend billions to keep them out of the country. And citizens of the industrialized West pay hundreds of dollars a year in taxes or cash for someone to cart away trash that would be a valuable commodity in poorer parts of the world. The Price of Everything starts with a simple premise: there is a price behind each choice that we make, whether we're deciding to have a baby, drive a car, or buy a book. We often fail to appreciate just how critical prices are as a motivating force shaping our lives. But their power becomes clear when distorted prices steer our decisions the wrong way.  Eduardo Porter uncovers the true story behind the prices we pay and reveals what those prices are actually telling us. He takes us on a global economic adventure, from comparing the relative price of a vote in corrupt São Tomé and in the ostensibly uncorrupt United States, to assessing the cost of happiness in Bhutan, to deducing the dollar value we assign to human life. His unique approach helps explain: * Why polygamous societies actually place a higher value on women than monogamous ones. * Why someone may find more value in a $14 million license plate than the standard issue, $95 one. * Why some government agencies believe one year of life for a senior citizen is four times more valuable than that of a younger person.  Porter weaves together the constant-and often unconscious-cost and value assessments we all make every day. While exploring the fascinating story behind the price of everything from marriage and death to mattresses and horsemeat, Porter draws unexpected connections that bridge a wide range of disciplines and cultures. The result is a cogent and insightful narrative about how the world really works.Watch a Video",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,304,3.35,1346,224,The Price of Everything: Solving the Mystery of Why We Pay What We Do,Nonfiction|Economics|Business|Psychology|Economics|Finance,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442738362l/9640383.jpg,304,,,,,,,,,

Ambitious ideas about extra dimensions, exotic particles, multiple universes, and strings have captured the public’s imagination -- and the imagination of experts. But these ideas have not been tested experimentally, and some, like string theory, seem to offer no possibility of being tested. Yet these speculations dominate the field, attracting the best talent and much of the funding and creating a climate in which emerging physicists are often penalized for pursuing other avenues. As Smolin points out, the situation threatens to impede the very progress of science. With clarity, passion, and authority, Smolin offers an unblinking assessment of the troubles that face modern physics -- and an encouraging view of where the search for the next big idea may lead.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,416,3.98,7670,298,The Trouble With Physics,Science|Science|Physics|Nonfiction|Science|Popular Science|Philosophy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390467381l/782057.jpg,416,,,,,,,,,

It isn't difficult to understand how and why Genet was able to reproduce the novel under such circumstances, because Our Lady Of The Flowers is nothing less than a mythic recreation of Genet's past and then - present history. Combining memories with facts, fantasies, speculations, irrational dreams, tender emotion, empathy, and philosophical insights, Genet probably made his isolation bearable by retreating into a world not only of his own making, but one over which he had total control.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,216,4.03,4586,225,Our Lady of the Flowers,Fiction|Cultural|France|Classics|Lgbt|Glbt|Queer|Literature,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1414962933l/53003.jpg,216,,,,,,,,,

53810,Bob Halloran,"Box-office sensations Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale star in The Fighter, in theaters December 10, 2010, and Irish Thunder is the story behind the film, the story of ''Irish'' Micky Ward's unlikely road to the world light welterweight title. Welcome to Lowell, Massachusetts -- where anything can happen. Rocky Marciano fought at the Auditorium in 1947. Mike Tyson fought there in his Golden Gloves days. Sugar Ray Leonard won there, as did Marvin Hagler. Each of them prepared for his battle downstairs in the boiler room, just like thousands of other kids. ''Irish'' Micky Ward grew up in the 1970s and 80s as a tough kid from Lowell, Massachusetts -- a town where boxers were once bred as a means of survival. A hard worker who overcame bad luck, bad management, and chronic pain in his hands, he avoided the pitfall of poverty and dead-end work that plagued Lowell to become a Golden Gloves junior welterweight. Ward participated in street fights from an early age and was forever known by his opponents and spectators as the underdog. But with his incredible ability to suddenly drop an opponent late in a fight with his trademark left hook, he kept proving everyone wrong. After fifteen years of boxing, a string of defeats, and three years of retirement, Micky battled Arturo Gatti in 2002 in the battle that was later named ''Fight of the Year'' by Ring magazine and dubbed ''Fight of the Century'' by boxing writers and fans across the country. Ten rounds of brutal action ended with Micky winning by decision, and reviving enthusiasm for a sport that had been weighted down by years of showboating and corruption. ESPN and Boston television reporter Bob Halloran recounts Micky's rise to hero status, his rivalry with his imprisoned brother, and the negotiations, betrayals, and drugs that ultimately shaped a wild youth into a nationally respected boxer.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,296,4,276,24,Irish Thunder: The Hard Life and Times of Micky Ward,Sports and Games|Sports|Nonfiction|Biography,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328850226l/2097226.jpg,296,,,,,,,,,
46631,Chuck Palahniuk,"With more than 300,000 copies sold, Chuck Palahniuk's brilliant first novel and cult classic is being reissued with a new Introduction by the authorAn underground classic since its first publication in 1996, Fight Club is widely recognized as one of the most original and provocative novels of the last decade. Now the author adds his own voice to the critical debate he generated. In a new Introduction, he discusses the various interpretations in the popular media of Fight Club and the movie it inspired, as well as his personal reactions to the work's reception and the influence that the Fight Club phenomenon has already had on our culture. Chuck Palahniuk's darkly funny first novel tells the story of a disenfranchised young man frustrated with his bureacratic job and superficial relationships and disillusioned with the consumer culture's prepackaged pleasures. Relief for him and his peers comes in the form of Tyler Durden, the intensely charismatic inventor of Fight Club. Waiters, clerks, and middlemen seek out the visceral satisfaction of secret after-hours boxing matches in the basements of bars, thinking they have found a way to live beyond their confining and stultifying lives.

Maurice Herzog and other members of the French Alpine Club had resolved to try. Their goal was a 26,493-foot Himalayan peak called Annapurna. But unlike other climbs, which draw on the experience of prior reconnaissance, the routes up Annapurna had never been analyzed before. Herzog and his team had to locate the mountain using sketchy, crude maps, pick out a single, untried route, and go for the summit. Annapurna is the unforgettable account of this dramatic and heroic climb, and of its harrowing aftermath.

6848,James  Jones,"""When compared to the fact that he might very well be dead by this time tomorrow, whether he was courageous or not today was pointless, empty. When compared to the fact that he might be dead tomorrow, everything was pointless. Life was pointless. Whether he looked at a tree or not was pointless. It just didn't make any difference. It was pointless to the tree, it was pointless to every man in his outfit, pointless to everybody in the whole world. Who cared? It was not pointless only to him; and when he was dead, when he ceased to exist, it would be pointless to him too. More important: Not only would it be pointless, it would have been pointless, all along."" Such is the ultimate significance of war in The Thin Red Line (1962), James Jones's fictional account of the battle between American and Japanese troops on the island of Guadalcanal. The narrative shifts effortlessly among multiple viewpoints within C-for-Charlie Company, from commanding officer Capt. James Stein, his psychotic first sergeant Eddie Welsh, and the young privates they send into battle. The descriptions of combat conditions--and the mental states it induces--are unflinchingly realistic, including the dialog (in which a certain word Norman Mailer rendered as ""fug"" 15 years earlier in The Naked and the Dead appears properly spelled on numerous occasions). This is more than a classic of combat fiction; it is one of the most significant explorations of male identity in American literature, establishing Jones as a novelist of the caliber of Herman Melville and Stephen Crane.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,475,3.98,11388,216,The Thin Red Line,Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|War|Classics|War|Military Fiction|War|World War II,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1422723999l/92417.jpg,475,,,,,,,,,

37542,Janice  Ross,"An alternate cover edition can be found here.Get excited, cry, curse, hate, love, and despise! If you’ve already read Damaged Girls I, then these emotions should be familiar. The Damaged Girls Family & Relationship Series began with an introduction to the complex love triangle of Steven Briggs, Jillian McConnell and Jessica Rodney. In the second book of the series, Damaged Girls II, get pulled deeper into the trauma and gain valuable knowledge of why Jillian and Jessica might be such easy targets for a womanizer such as Stevie. Jillian has to come to terms with the crumbling idea of love that she desperately needed to find in Stevie. And Jessica is forced to grow up and away from the man she so badly wanted to keep forever. Stevie even realizes that he needs to get a grip on the drama he created years back; while his decisions and behaviors continue to spiral deeper into selfishness. Unfortunately, Stevie’s insatiable appetite has not diminished, only causing him to become less likeable. Will the three ever learn? As life progresses, we must confront our past, move into our present and plan sensibly for our future. How will Stevie, Jillian and Jessica cope, when life just can’t seem to smile in favor of their original desires? Damaged Girls is not a romance novel outlined in love. It is not pleasant and idealistic, but very cruel and extremely unsavory. In fact, it is deep and rather dark at times. The story focuses on emotional, physical and sexual abuse, and how easily its effects can cause some to own the title of Damaged Girls.

53435,Carolyn Merchant|Roger S. Gottlieb,"As we survey the effects of modernism—environmental destruction, the net consumption of irreplaceable natural resources, the ever-widening gulf between first and third worlds—we are forced to grapple with the consequences of the domination of nature by human beings. The readings gathered here join these issues with critical theory to examine the ongoing struggle to rediscover the nature within human beings and to reconnect it with external nature.Starting with an examination of the use of modernist thought as legitimation for the domination of nature, the collection progresses on a broad front: It examines how first-world economies create third-world dependency; the connections between poverty and population; how basic needs could be fulfilled in a green sustainable economy; the debate among deep, social, and socialist ecologists over the new ecological worldview; ecofeminism and the liberation of both women and nature; environmental justice for minorities and third-world peoples; the need for new spiritual relations between people and nature; and a new postmodern science that offers people a partnership with nature. The conclusion presents the ""Principles of Environmental Justice,"" adopted by the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit.Each essay stands on its own as a contribution to the ecological debate, but the cumulative effect is clearly to ask how critical theorists, current environmental philosophers, and scientists propose to liberate both human beings and nature.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,397,3.83,35,2,Ecology,Philosophy,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1365463374l/340383.jpg,397,,,,,,,,,

35855,Herbert P. Bix,"Winner of the Pulitzer PrizeIn this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.",,Paperback,9.78E+12,832,3.81,1892,148,Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan,History|Cultural|Japan|Nonfiction|Biography|Cultural|Asia,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407707626l/93959.jpg,832,,,,,,,,,

19076,Milorad Pavić|Christina Pribićević-Zorić,"Somewhere on the borders of what is now Russia, in the late 9th century A.D., the great kaghan, ruler of the Khazars, summons the three leading scholars of the known world—Christian, Jewish, Moslem—to debate before the court which religion he and his people will adopt. This is the last thing we know about the Khazars, for in the immediate aftermath of this event, the tribe is utterly destroyed, vanishing from history...In 1689, in the lost lands where the Danube empties into the Black Sea, the Turks and Slavs are engaged in pitched battle. In the fighting, three men come face to face: Avram Brancovich, the noble warlord and litterateur; Yusuf Masudi, the Turkish lute player; and Samuel Cohen, the Jew. Each has (literally) dreamed the existence of the other two and has been tracking them down; at the moment of their encounter, all three die... Three hundred years later, in 1982 in Istanbul, three scholars (Christian, Jew, Moslem) come together to pool their separately compiled fragmentary information about the lost tribe of the Khazars, once known to have been gathered into a single book of knowledge, The Khazar Dictionary, published in 1691 in an edition of 500 copies. 498 were destroyed by the Inquisition, one was 'consumed' and one, the ""Golden Book"" (with poisoned inks), survived, deadly to any Unbeliever who ignored the warnings and read more than nine  . Now, once again at the precise moment when the three scholars may together be able to reconstitute at least part of the dictionary, two of them die... What is the story of the Khazars?

Det blir en gedigen skuffelse; han vil så mye, skjønner så lite, og får ingenting til. Med et tilsynelatende grunnløst pågangsmot fortsetter han likevel å skrive og lese.

Slik blir dette en roman om nye, sterke vennskap, og et alvorlig, omskakende kjærlighetsforhold, inntil romanen igjen når frem til det eksistensielle omdreiningspunktet som kanskje er den avgjørende impulsen for romanserien: faren dør, Karl Ove debuterer som forfatter og alt bryter sammen.

19930,Cliff Graham,"In ancient Israel, at the crossroads of the great trading routes, a man named Benaiah is searching for a fresh start in life. He has joined a band of soldiers led by a warlord named David, seeking to bury the past that refuses to leave him. Their ragged army is disgruntled and full of reckless men. Some are loyal to David, but others are only with him for the promise of captured wealth. While the ruthless and increasingly mad King Saul marches hopelessly against the powerful Philistines, loyal son Jonathan in tow, the land of the Hebrew tribes has never been more despondent---and more in need of rescue. Over the course of ten days, from snowy mountain passes to sword-wracked battlefields, Benaiah and his fellow mercenaries must call upon every skill they have to survive and establish the throne for David---if they don't kill each other first.

Between the things I’d seen during my tour of duty and the things I’d done during my years as a member of OtherWorld, nothing could faze me. Nothing. Except for HER. She’s everything that is good in the world. At least, my world. Everything I’ve ever done has been for her. Always for her. I feel as if I need her to breathe, to feel alive. But I can’t have Marissa. She’s to innocent, to damn perfect. And me? I’m not good enough for that girl. She deserves better, someone who would spend their life CHERISHING her. Not breaking her heart. Marissa Between my brother and Wroth Niall I’d been protected from the world for most of my life. You would think I was still a little girl the way they treated me. But I wasn’t made out of glass. It would take a lot to break this girl. Because if a childhood cancer hadn’t kicked my butt, nothing would. Right? Wrong. All I’ve ever wanted was for him to look at me. Really look at me and see that I wasn’t a fragile piece of porcelain that would break if he touched me. What I got was a lot more…but nowhere close to enough. Once I touched heaven—at least heaven for me—and now I didn’t know how to go back to what Wroth and I had had before. I can’t go back to the life I was living before my short time with Wroth. It would destroy me to stay that close, when I know that I’m not what he really wants.

Manners and morality are also victims of Wilde's sharp wit in Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance and An Ideal Husband, in which snobbery and hypocrisy are laid bare. In Salomé and A Florentine Tragedy, Wilde makes powerful use of historical settings to explore the complex relationship between sex and power. The range of these plays displays Wilde's delight in artifice, masks and disguises, and reveals the pretentions of the social world in which he himself played such a dazzling and precarious part.Richard Allen Cave's introduction and notes discuss the themes of the plays and Wilde's innovative methods of staging.

In a face-off between supernatural beings and Jefferson's Tim Burton-esque vibe there really was no contest. But ghosts—unsurprisingly—can’t help pay the rent. So when Sadie and her friends are offered an undisclosed sum of money from an anonymous client to find a link between four historical haunted locations, it’s an easy sell. During their cross-country investigation, Sadie finds herself forgetting about Jefferson’s macabre tendencies and falling for his sweetness, even if his idea of a love letter reads more like a note from a serial killer. And she can’t stop thinking about his annoyingly irresistible deep green eyes. As Sadie’s feelings get more tangled up with Jefferson, their group puts together the final pieces of a 100 year old mystery—one that will change Sadie’s life forever.

After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to signal Earth that he’s alive – and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills – and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?--podiumpublishing.com",,Audible Audio,,,4.4,627121,66280,The Martian,Science Fiction|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458411230l/29245055.jpg,,,,,,,,,,

13277,Elizabeth Gilbert,"In The Signature of All Things, Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction, inserting her inimitable voice into an enthralling story of love, adventure and discovery. Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the novel follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry Whittaker—a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, Henry's brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her father's money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As Alma's research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite direction — into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artist — but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life.Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, The Signature of All Things soars across the globe—from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, who — born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial Revolution — bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas. Written in the bold, questing spirit of that singular time, Gilbert's wise, deep, and spellbinding tale is certain to capture the hearts and minds of readers.

This first omnibus edition of three full-length novels, all set in the respectable Baltimore streets she has made so particularly her own, encompasses the range of eccentricities and compromises to which they are driven. Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant follows the disintegration and eventual reaffirmation of the Tull family - fierce, embittered Pearl, left by Beck to raise handsome, thrusting Cody, Jenny, the pediatrician losing herself in devotion to others, and docile Ezra, whose attempts to unite them all around a table at his eccentric Homesick Restaurant are the focus of their differences and their bond. In The Accidental Tourist, Macon - a man of habit and routine, who writes guide books for businessmen who hate to leave home - is confronted by chaos in his own family life. Between aching sadness and glorious absurdity, Macon hesitantly emerges from his sage cocoon into the vibrant, unpredictable world of the outrageous Muriel...And Breathing Lessons, which won the Pulitzer Prize, lays bare the anatomy of a marriage. On the round trip to a friend's funeral, Maggie and Ira Moran make detours literal and metaphorical - into the lives of grown children, old friends, total strangers and their own past - and, despite Ira's disappointments and Maggie's optimistic determination to rearrange life as she would like it to be, an old married couple fall in love all over again.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,1056,4.15,670,16,An Omnibus: Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant / The Accidental Tourist / Breathing Lessons,Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344156609l/946516.jpg,1056,,,,,,,,,

But before leaving his much-loved Yorkshire, Bryson insisted on taking one last trip around old Blighty, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had for so long been his home. The resulting book, Notes from a Small Island, is a eulogy to the country that produced Marmite, George Formby, by-elections, milky tea, place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey and Shellow Bowels, Gardeners' Question Time and people who say, 'Mustn't grumble'. Britain will never seem the same again.Once ensconced back home in New Hampshire, Bryson couldn't resist the invitation to write a weekly dispatch for the Mail on Sunday's Night & Day magazine. Notes from a Big Country is a collection of eighteen months' worth of his popular columns about that strangest of phenomena - the American way of life. Whether discussing the dazzling efficiency of the garbage disposal unit, the exoticism of having your groceries bagged for you, or the mind-numbing frequency of commercial breaks on American TV, Bill Bryson brings his inimitable brand of bemused wit to bear on the world's richest and craziest country.The Complete Notes combines two of Bill Bryson's best-loved travel books in one volume, It demonstrates his unique take on life - from either side of the pond.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,544,4.09,894,37,Bill Bryson: The Complete Notes,Travel|Nonfiction|Humor|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1289491565l/42883.jpg,544,,,,,,,,,

34724,Mitchell Zuckoff,"Lost in Shangri-La recounts the incredible true-life adventure of twenty-four officers and enlisted men and women who boarded a transport plane for a sightseeing trip , which became an unforgettable battle for survival when the plane crashed.On May 13, 1945, twenty-four officers and enlisted men and women stationed on what was then Dutch New Guinea boarded a transport plane named the Gremlin Special for a sightseeing trip over ""Shangri-La."" A beautiful and mysterious valley surrounded by steep, jagged mountain peaks deep within the island's uncharted jungle, this hidden retreat was named after the fabled paradise in the bestselling novel Lost Horizon. But unlike the peaceful Tibetan monks of James Hilton's book, this Shangri-La was the home of Stone Age warriors - spear-carrying tribesmen rumored to be headhunters and cannibals. But the pleasure tour became an unforgettable battle for survival when the plane crashed. Miraculously, three passengers survived - WAC Corporal Margaret Hastings, Lieutenant John McCollom, and Sergeant Kenneth Decker. Margaret, barefoot and burned, had no choice but to wear her dead best friend's shoes. McCollom, grieving the death of his twin brother also aboard the Gremlin Special, masked his grief with stoicism. Decker, too, was severely burned and suffered a bloody, gaping head wound.Emotionally devastated, badly injured, and vulnerable to disease, parasites, and poisonous snakes in the wet jungle climate, the trio faced certain death unless they left the wreckage. Caught between man-eating headhunters and the enemy Japanese, with nothing to sustain them but a handful of candy and their own fortitude, they endured a harrowing trek down the mountainside - an exhausting journey into the unknown that would lead them straight into a primitive tribe of superstitious natives who had never before seen a white man - or woman.Drawn from personal interviews, declassified Army documents, personal photos and mementos, a daily journal kept between the crash and the rescue effort, and original film footage, Lost in Shangri-La recounts this incredible true-life adventure for the first time. Mitchell Zuckoff reveals how the determined trio - dehydrated, sick, and in pain - traversed the dense jungle foliage to find help; how a brave band of Filipino-American paratroopers, led by a dogged captain, risked their own lives to save the survivors; how the Americans would be protected by and eventually befriend a noble native chief and his people; and how a cowboy colonel was willing to risk a previously untried rescue mission to get them out.A riveting work of narrative nonfiction that vividly brings to life an odyssey at times terrifying, enlightening, and comic, Lost in Shangri-La is a thrill ride from beginning to end.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,384,3.84,37554,2677,"Lost in Shangri-la: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II",Nonfiction|History|War|World War II|War|Adventure,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524514103l/9729504.jpg,384,,,,,,,,,

38307,E.B. White|Garth Williams," This is the first children's book by the distinguished author E. B. White. Stuart Little, the hero, is a mouse in the family of Frederick C. Little and is a debonair little character with a shy, engaging manner and a somewhat philosophical turn of mind. He is a great help around the house, and everybody except Snowbell the cat likes him a great deal. In spite of his small size, Stuart gets around in the world, riding a Fifth Avenue bus, racing (and winning in) a sailboat in Central Park, teaching school for a day, and so on. His size -- just over two inches -- does give him some trouble now and then, like the time he was rolled up in the window shade, or when he got dumped into a garbage scow. But on the whole his life is a happy one.

And I can assure you, it will get so dark that you’ll find yourself feeling around the blackened corners of my mind, seeking a door handle that isn’t there. Don’t mistake this for a confession.

Let him not love the earth too deeply. Let him not laugh too gladly when the water runs through his fingers, nor stand too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire. Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or valley.
